NMHC provides Free Care and Discounted Care to eligible Applicants who are uninsured through two methods: \\"uninsured sliding fee scale assistance\\" and \\"uninsured catastrophic assistance.\\" If an Applicant qualifies under both methods, NMHC will apply the method that is most beneficial to the Applicant. Despite qualification under either method, if there is reason to believe that an Applicant may have assets in excess of 600% of the then current Federal Poverty Guideline applicable to the Applicant's Family Size and that are available to pay for medical services, NMHC may require the Applicant to provide information about such assets, and the Free Care Committee may consider those assets in deciding whether, and to what extent, to extend Free Care or Discounted Care. Free Care and Discounted Care shall be available for those Uninsured Patients who are Illinois Residents. The NIMC policy in place does not reflect a residency requirement. Non-Residents who are Uninsured Patients are not eligible for Free Care or Discounted Care. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no residency requirement for Uninsured Applicants receiving Emergency Services. Financial Assistance will only be applied to self-pay balances, after all third-party benefits/resources are reasonably exhausted, including, but not limited to, benefits from insurance carriers (e.g., health, home, auto liability, worker's compensation, or employer funded health reimbursement accounts), government programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid or other federal, state, or local programs), or proceeds from litigation, settlements, and/or private fundraising efforts (collectively, \\"Third-Party Funding Sources\\"). Patients receiving Financial Assistance and who require Medically Necessary care (other than Emergency Services) must, whenever possible, be screened for eligibility for Medicaid, Health Insurance Exchange, or other available payment programs and, if found eligible, the Patient must fully cooperate with enrollment requirements prior to the procedure being scheduled and/or services being rendered. Eligible Patients who fail or refuse to enroll in available Medicaid, Health Insurance Exchange, or other available payment programs may be ineligible for Financial Assistance. NMHC (or its agent), at its discretion, may assess a Patient's or Guarantor's Financial Assistance eligibility by means other than a completed Application. In such instances, eligibility determinations may include the use of information provided by credit reporting agencies, public records, or other objective and reasonably accurate means of assessing a Patient's or Guarantor's Program eligibility. An uninsured Patient demonstrating eligibility under one or more of the following programs shall be deemed eligible for NMHC's Free and Discounted Care program and will not be required to provide additional supporting documentation for financial assistance. A. Homelessness B. Deceased with no estate C. Mental incapacitation with no one to act on the patient's behalf D. Medicaid eligibility, but not on date of service for non-covered service E. Enrollment in the following assistance programs for low-income individuals having eligibility criteria at or below 200% of the federal poverty income guidelines; 1. Women, Infants and Children Nutrition Program (WIC) 2. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) 3. Illinois Free Lunch and Breakfast Program 4. Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) 5. Enrollment in an organized community-based program providing access to medical care that assess and documents limited low income financial 6. Receipt of grant assistance for medical services Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital & Clinics: 09/01/2018 - 08/31/2019 In addition to FPG guidelines, Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital & Clinics utilizes other factors to determine eligibility for free or discounted care per the organization's charity care policy. These factors include: 1. Family income relative to family size and other related factors such as current financial obligations 2. Employment status, including, but not limited to, future earning capacity sufficient to meet the patient's financial obligations in an acceptable period of time 3. Future and current ability to pay 4. Medical expenses, including pharmaceutical expenses, as a percentage of a patient's annual gross income, the amount of total medical bills outstanding, and the frequency of payments to be made in relation to the factors above 5.

THE RESULTANT CALCULATED COST WAS THEN OFFSET BY ANY PAYMENTS RECEIVED THAT WERE DESIGNATED FOR THE PAYMENT OF PATIENT BILLS QUALIFYING FOR A CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT (AS DEFINED IN THE HEALTHCARE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION'S PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES BOARD STATEMENT 15, VALUATION AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION OF CHARITY CARE AND BAD DEBTS BY INSTITUTIONAL HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS). THE PHYSICIAN GROUPS, INCLUDING NMG, RMG, MMG, AND CPC/CMS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO FILE A MEDICARE COST REPORT. AN INTERNALLY CALCULATED COST-TO-CHARGE RATIO SPECIFIC TO THE PHYSICIAN GROUPS WAS USED TO DETERMINE THE COST OF CHARITY CARE FOR NMG. THE RESULTANT CALCULATED COST WAS THEN OFFSET BY ANY PAYMENTS, CONSISTENT WITH THE METHODOLOGY FOR THE HOSPITALS. THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF BAD DEBT, MEDICAID, MEDICARE OR ANY OTHER FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL INDIGENT HEALTHCARE PROGRAM IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE UNREIMBURSED COST FIGURE FOR CHARITY CARE. THE COSTS OF CHARITY CARE IN THIS REPORT DIFFER FROM NMHC'S NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 WHERE THEY WERE CALCULATED BY APPLYING A COST-TO-CHARGE RATIO DEVELOPED PRIOR TO FILING NMH'S, NLFH'S, CDH'S, DELNOR'S, KISH'S, MARIANJOY'S, AND NIMC'S FISCAL YEAR 2019 MEDICARE COST REPORTS TO CHARGES FOREGONE FOR CHARITY CARE. THE FISCAL YEAR 2019 MEDICARE COST REPORTS WERE COMPLETED AFTER THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE ISSUED. THE COSTS OF CHARITY CARE FOR THE HOSPITALS INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT WERE CALCULATED USING THE COST-TO-CHARGE RATIOS FROM NMH'S, NLFH'S, CDH'S, DELNOR'S, KISH'S, MARIANJOY'S, AND NIMC'S COST REPORTS FILED IN FEBRUARY OF 2020 FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019. COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT SERVICES - THE COST OF LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS INCLUDES BOTH THE COST OF EMPLOYEES AND NONEMPLOYEES TO PROVIDE TRANSLATION SERVICES TO NMHC HOSPITAL PATIENTS AND FAMILY MEMBERS. EDUCATION - UNREIMBURSED EDUCATION COSTS INCLUDE THE COST OF NMHC'S MEDICAL RESIDENCY, FELLOWSHIP AND INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS LESS ANY THIRD-PARTY PAYOR REIMBURSEMENTS AND FEES RECEIVED. SUBSIDIZED HEALTH SERVICES - SUBSIDIZED HEALTH SERVICES INCLUDE THE UNCOMPENSATED COST OF PROVIDING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES, HEALTH EDUCATION AND INFORMATION AND PROGRAMS TO POSITIVELY IMPACT THE WELLNESS OF THE COMMUNITY. COSTS CALCULATED WERE OFFSET BY ANY REIMBURSEMENT RECEIVED FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. THE UNREIMBURSED COST FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WAS ALSO ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF CHARITY CARE AND GOVERNMENT SPONSORED INDIGENT HEALTHCARE. RESEARCH - NMHC PROVIDES SUPPORT TO ADVANCE MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND ACADEMIC PURSUITS. THE REPORTED SUPPORT INCLUDES THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF FUNDS PROVIDED FOR RESEARCH PROJECTS AND UNREIMBURSED OPERATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS TO SUPPORT CLINICAL RESEARCH THAT OCCURS AT NMH, NMG, CDH AND MJRH.

IMPORTANTLY, THESE PROGRAMS CREATE PATHWAYS FOR AT-RISK MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY TO SEEK JOBS WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND ALSO ARE IN PLACE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO LEARN ABOUT AND POTENTIALLY EXPLORE HEALTHCARE CAREERS. ALLIED HEALTH SCHOOLS AT NMH NMH OPERATES FOUR ACCREDITED ALLIED HEALTH SCHOOLS - DIAGNOSTIC MEDICAL SONOGRAPHY, NUCLEAR MEDICINE TECHNOLOGY, RADIATION THERAPY AND RADIOLOGY - AS WELL AS A HISTOTECHNOLOGY PROGRAM, POST-PRIMARY CT AND MRI PROGRAMS, AND A MEDICAL ASSISTANT PROGRAM. THE 21-MONTH CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS ARE OPEN TO EMPLOYEES AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. MANY STUDENTS COME FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY, AS WELL AS FROM AFFILIATED COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. LEADERS OF THESE PROGRAMS VISIT CITY HIGH SCHOOLS, COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO INTRODUCE VARIOUS MEDICAL FIELDS TO PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS AND INCREASE THEIR GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF VARIOUS ALLIED HEALTH FIELDS. THE CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS AIM TO ADDRESS THE NEED FOR ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN THE FIELD. IN ADDITION TO TRAINING THE NATION'S FUTURE PHYSICIANS, FEINBERG HAS FURTHER RESPONDED TO THE ANTICIPATED SHORTAGE OF MEDICAL PROVIDERS BY OFFERING A MASTER'S-LEVEL PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT PROGRAM. PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE MEMBERS OF PRIMARY CARE TEAMS THAT INCLUDE MANY LEVELS OF PROVIDERS AND CAN EFFICIENTLY DELIVER THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF CARE TO EXTENDED GROUPS OF PATIENTS. THROUGH FEINBERG'S PROGRAM, PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS ARE EDUCATED AND TRAINED WITHIN THE MEDICAL SCHOOL SETTING AND GAIN CLINICAL EXPERIENCE AT NMHC HOSPITALS. CLINICAL EXPERIENCE AT NMHC HOSPITALS NMHC HOSPITALS PROVIDE THE IMPORTANT CLINICAL SETTING FOR THE EDUCATION OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF HEALTHCARE WORKERS, INCLUDING PHYSICIANS, NURSES, PHARMACISTS, LABORATORY PROFESSIONALS, ALLIED HEALTH WORKERS AND SKILLED TECHNICIANS. THROUGH CLINICAL AFFILIATIONS WITH TOP REGIONAL UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES AND ESTABLISHED CLINICAL ROTATIONS, MENTORING, CLINICIAN SHADOWING, TRADITIONAL DIDACTIC LECTURES AND OTHER TEACHING PROGRAMS, WE PROVIDE CLINICAL SETTINGS FOR THE EDUCATION OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS, MANY OF WHOM WILL BECOME PROFESSIONALS IN FIELDS IDENTIFIED AS AREAS OF CURRENT OR FUTURE WORKFORCE SHORTAGE IN THE NATIONAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

NMHC OFFERS A MULTITUDE OF OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPOSE STUDENTS TO POTENTIAL HEALTHCARE CAREERS AND TO FOSTER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE FIELD. ONGOING, COMPREHENSIVE, ON-THE-JOB TRAINING AND YOUTH PROGRAMS FOR HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE AND POST-GRADUATE STUDENTS ARE OFFERED AT EVERY HOSPITAL IN THE HEALTH SYSTEM IN BOTH CLINICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE SETTINGS. NM HAS LONG INVESTED IN PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, INCLUDING PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUTH. IN 2011, NMH EMBARKED ON AN EDUCATIONAL PARTNERSHIP WITH WESTINGHOUSE COLLEGE PREPARATORY HIGH SCHOOL (WESTINGHOUSE), A SELECTIVE-ENROLLMENT HIGH SCHOOL ON CHICAGO'S WEST SIDE, TO PROVIDE TALENTED HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT AND PURSUE POST-HIGH-SCHOOL EDUCATION IN HEALTHCARE CAREERS. STUDENTS MEET FEINBERG FACULTY AND HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES, AND ARE PROVIDED A BEHIND-THE-SCENES UNDERSTANDING OF CLINICAL AREAS AND POTENTIAL CAREERS. THE PROGRAM ALSO INCLUDES MENTORING, AN INTENSIVE SUMMER PROGRAM, DISTANCE LEARNING, ACT TEST PREPARATION, AND LEADERSHIP AND LIFE SKILLS DEVELOPMENT. THE PROGRAM HAD 19 PARTICIPANTS IN FY19. REFLECTING THE GEOGRAPHICAL EXPANSION OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM, THE NM DISCOVERY PROGRAM, FORMERLY KNOWN AS MEDICAL EXPLORERS, GREW TO THREE CHAPTERS IN FY19: NM DISCOVERY PROGRAM CENTRAL, NM DISCOVERY PROGRAM WEST AND NM DISCOVERY PROGRAM NORTH. THROUGHOUT THE TWO-YEAR PROGRAM, STUDENTS ARE EXPOSED TO A BROAD RANGE OF ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE THEIR INTEREST IN HEALTHCARE CAREERS. IN ADDITION, THE PROGRAM FOSTERS CHARACTER AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, CULTIVATES LIFE SKILLS, PROVIDES COMMUNITY SERVICE AND LEADERSHIP EXPERIENCE, AND OFFERS MENTORSHIP AND NETWORKING OPPORTUNITIES. ONCE-MONTHLY ACTIVITIES INCLUDE TOURS, GUEST SPEAKERS, GROUP DISCUSSION AND HANDS-ON PROJECTS. IN FY19, 54 STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN THE CENTRAL CHAPTER AND 60 PARTICIPATED IN THE WEST CHAPTER. THE INAUGURAL CLASS OF THE NORTH CHAPTER WELCOMED 24 STUDENTS. ADDITIONALLY, EACH SUMMER, A SELECT NUMBER OF THESE STUDENTS ARE OFFERED INTERNSHIPS IN VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT NMH; NMH HOSTED EIGHT SUMMER INTERNS IN FY19 FROM THE NM DISCOVERY PROGRAM. SINCE THE PROGRAM BEGAN, MANY PARTICIPANTS HAVE PURSUED CAREERS IN NURSING AND OTHER HEALTHCARE FIELDS, AND SEVERAL ARE NOW EMPLOYED AT NMH. IN FY19, THE HEALTH SYSTEM BEGAN PLANNING FOR THE NEXT CHAPTER OF THE NM DISCOVERY PROGRAM - NM DISCOVERY PROGRAM GREATER DEKALB CHAPTER - WHICH LAUNCHED IN THE FALL OF 2019. ADDITIONAL EXPANSION OF BOTH THE NM DISCOVERY PROGRAM AND THE NM DISCOVERY PROGRAM INTERNSHIP ARE EXPECTED IN COMING YEARS. SINCE 2016, NM HUNTLEY AND NM MCHENRY HOSPITALS HAVE OFFERED THE YOUTH RESIDENCY PROGRAM. WORKING WITH LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLS, THE PROGRAM PROVIDES INTENSIVE JOB SHADOWING AND MENTORSHIP WITH THE GOAL OF SPARKING STUDENTS' INTEREST IN HEALTH CAREERS AND ULTIMATELY RETURNING TO WORK IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. FROM LEARNING TO READ A MRI, TO INSPECTING CELL TISSUES FOR TUMORS, STUDENTS ARE IMMERSED IN A PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ENVIRONMENT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE HIGH-SCHOOL BASED CURRICULUM. EACH CHAPTER SERVES UP-TO 30 STUDENTS ANNUALLY. IN FY19, NM KISHWAUKEE BECAME THE NEWEST HOSPITAL IN THE HEALTH SYSTEM TO OFFER PROJECT SEARCH, A PROGRAM FOR STUDENT INTERNS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THE HOSPITAL BECAME THE FIRST HOST SITE IN DEKALB, ILLINOIS, AND JOINS NM CDH AND NM DELNOR IN PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM. PROJECT SEARCH IS AN EMPLOYABILITY SKILLS TRAINING PROGRAM THAT ASSISTS STUDENTS WHO HAVE INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES TRANSITION FROM HIGH SCHOOL TO PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYMENT. THE HALLMARK OF PROJECT SEARCH IS TOTAL WORKPLACE IMMERSION, WHICH FACILITATES A SEAMLESS COMBINATION OF CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION, CAREER EXPLORATION AND HANDS-ON TRAINING. DURING THE ONE-YEAR PROGRAM, STUDENTS WHO ARE IN THEIR LAST YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL PARTICIPATE IN THREE 10-WEEK INTERNSHIPS WITHIN THE HOSPITAL TO EXPLORE THEIR VOCATIONAL SKILLS, ABILITIES AND POTENTIAL CAREER PATHS. THE INITIAL COHORT AT NM KISHWAUKEE INCLUDED 12 INTERNS FROM LOCAL SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. THE GOAL OF THE PROGRAM IS TO ACHIEVE 100% EMPLOYMENT AT THE END OF THE INTERNSHIP; PROJECT SEARCH PROGRAMS AT NM CDH AND NM DELNOR HAVE ACHIEVED MORE THAN 90% EMPLOYMENT FOR SEVERAL YEARS. COMMUNITY HEALTH EDUCATION COMMUNITY-BASED EDUCATION PROGRAMS ARE OFFERED ACROSS THE HEALTH SYSTEM AND IN COORDINATION WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS.

      "explanationText": "NMHC'S MISSION SETS FORTH OUR COMMITMENT TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE AND TO ADVANCE MEDICAL RESEARCH AND EDUCATION, ONE PATIENT AT A TIME. THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN DESCRIBES THE BROAD-REACHING GOALS THAT SUPPORT THIS COMMITMENT AND ADDRESS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A TAX-EXEMPT ORGANIZATION. THE DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS DEVELOPS AND MAINTAINS A COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN FOR THE HEALTH SYSTEM, WHICH IS EXECUTED AT THE HOSPITAL LEVEL TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. REVIEWED ANNUALLY AND REVISED AS NEEDED, THE OBJECTIVES OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN ARE TO: 1. PROVIDE QUALITY MEDICAL CARE, REGARDLESS OF THE PATIENT'S ABILITY TO PAY. 2. HONOR NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE'S MISSION AND COMMITMENT TO THE COMMUNITY. 3. BE RESPONSIVE TO THE ASSESSED NEEDS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY SERVED BY EACH HOSPITAL. 4. FORGE RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. 5. EVALUATE THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT OF NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE PROGRAMMING, AND REPLICATE BY GEOGRAPHY AND/OR DISEASE STATE WITH SENSITIVITY TO THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF OUR PATIENTS, THEIR FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. 6. LEVERAGE OUR STRENGTHS AS A PREMIER ACADEMIC HEALTH SYSTEM TO TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF CAREGIVERS AND UTILIZE EVIDENCE-BASED MODELS FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH ENGAGEMENT. 7. LEVERAGE OUR BOND WITH NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO BE LEADERS IN QUALITY, ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE, SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY, PATIENT SAFETY AND RESEARCH-INFORMED TREATMENT. ALIGNED WITH OUR MISSIONS AND COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (ACA), EACH OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM HOSPITALS WORKS WITH COMMUNITY AND CAMPUS PARTNERS EVERY THREE YEARS TO COMPLETE A COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA) THAT IDENTIFIES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS OF RESIDENTS OF ITS COMMUNITY. WITH FEINBERG, NMHC BRINGS TO BEAR THE RESOURCES OF A WORLD-CLASS, INTEGRATED ACADEMIC HEALTH SYSTEM TO ADVANCE OUR COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN AND CHNA INITIATIVES IN WAYS THAT COULD NOT BE ACHIEVED AS STAND-ALONE HOSPITALS. PROVIDING BETTER CARE CLOSER TO HOME ALLOWS OUR COMMUNITIES ACCESS TO THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN EDUCATION AND RESEARCH THAT PREVIOUSLY MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. THIS INCLUDES: - SEEKING ROOT CAUSES TO HEALTH CONDITIONS, AND COLLABORATING WITH SCIENTISTS AND CLINICIANS TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS - ENHANCING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE - IMPROVING CLINICAL QUALITY - ADVANCING MEDICAL INNOVATION - ENSURING THAT A HIGHLY SKILLED HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE IS IN PLACE FOR DECADES TO COME - ADDRESSING THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH CHNAS PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT ENABLES HOSPITALS TO IDENTIFY HEALTH ISSUES OF GREATEST CONCERN AMONG RESIDENTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND DECIDE HOW BEST TO COMMIT RESOURCES TO THOSE AREAS, THEREBY MAKING THE GREATEST POSSIBLE IMPACT ON COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS. NMHC EMPLOYS A SYSTEMATIC, DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE HEALTH STATUS, BEHAVIORS AND NEEDS OF THE RESIDENTS OF EACH HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY. EACH CHNA SERVES AS A TOOL TOWARD REACHING THREE GOALS: 1. IMPROVE RESIDENTS' HEALTH STATUS, INCREASE THEIR LIFE SPANS AND ELEVATE THEIR OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE. A HEALTHY COMMUNITY IS ONE WHERE ITS RESIDENTS SUFFER LITTLE FROM PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ILLNESS AND ALSO ENJOY A HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE. 2. REDUCE THE HEALTH DISPARITIES AMONG RESIDENTS. BY GATHERING DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ALONG WITH HEALTH STATUS AND BEHAVIOR DATA, IT IS POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY POPULATION SEGMENTS THAT ARE MOST AT RISK FOR VARIOUS DISEASES AND INJURIES. INTERVENTION PLANS AIMED AT TARGETING THESE SEGMENTS MAY THEN BE DEVELOPED TO COMBAT SOME OF THE SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON RESIDENTS' HEALTH. 3. INCREASE ACCESSIBILITY TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR ALL COMMUNITY RESIDENTS. MORE ACCESSIBLE PREVENTIVE SERVICES ARE BENEFICIAL IN ACCOMPLISHING THE FIRST GOAL (IMPROVING HEALTH STATUS, INCREASING LIFE SPANS AND ELEVATING THE QUALITY OF LIFE), AS WELL AS LOWERING THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CARING FOR LATE-STAGE DISEASES RESULTING FROM A LACK OF PREVENTIVE CARE. THE CHNAS AND CORRESPONDING IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES WERE DEVELOPED WITH FEEDBACK FROM COMMUNITY HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES AND PUBLIC ORGANIZATIONS THAT UNDERSTAND AND HELP REPRESENT THE WIDE-RANGING HEALTHCARE NEEDS OF THE RESIDENTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THE CHNA IMPLEMENTATION PLANS ARE GROUNDED IN PUBLIC HEALTH MODELS DEVELOPED WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND FEINBERG FACULTY, IN WHICH RESIDENTS OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE INFORMED AND ABLE TO MAKE HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHOICES, MANAGE THEIR CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS AND RECEIVE MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES IN THE MOST APPROPRIATE SETTING. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR MISSION TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE IS BEST ACCOMPLISHED IN COLLABORATION WITH PARTNERS IN BOTH THE COMMUNITY AND WITHIN THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT COMPRISE NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE, INCLUDING THE HEALTH SYSTEM AND FEINBERG. OUR AFFILIATIONS WITH COMMUNITY-BASED HEALTHCARE AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS ENABLE THE HEALTH SYSTEM'S ORGANIZATIONS TO MEANINGFULLY IMPROVE ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY HEALTH CARE AND IMPLEMENT TARGETED PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THE HIGHEST-PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED LARGE-SCALE PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITIES USING THIS FRAMEWORK TO TARGET HIGH-PRIORITY HEALTH CONDITIONS AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE PUBLIC HEALTH MODELS TO ADDRESS PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS IDENTIFIED THROUGH OUR CHNAS. ONGOING EFFORTS DRAW ON NMHC'S AND FEINBERG'S STRENGTHS IN PUBLIC HEALTH, COMMUNICATION AND EDUCATION, AND INCLUDE PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS IN COMMUNITIES SERVED ACROSS THE HEALTH SYSTEM. OUR HOSPITALS HAVE ENDURING RELATIONSHIPS, OFTEN DECADES OLD, WITH LOCAL HEALTHCARE AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. THROUGH THESE PARTNERSHIPS, WE COLLABORATE ON DETERMINING PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS THROUGH THE CHNA PROCESS AND WORK TOGETHER TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS THAT RESPECT THE VARIED CULTURAL, SOCIOECONOMIC AND PRACTICAL NEEDS OF OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. NORTHWESTERN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL: NMH COLLABORATES WITH COMMUNITY-BASED HEALTH, EDUCATION AND SOCIAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE HEALTH EDUCATION, OUTREACH SERVICES AND FOCUSED DISEASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS, AND TO ENSURE THAT THE RESIDENTS OF OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE CONVENIENT ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY MEDICAL HOMES. NMH HAS FORMAL AND LONGSTANDING AFFILIATIONS WITH TWO FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHC) BASED IN THE COMMUNITY - NEAR NORTH HEALTH SERVICE CORPORATION AND ERIE FAMILY HEALTH CENTER - AS WELL AS WITH COMMUNITYHEALTH, THE LARGEST FREE HEALTH CLINIC IN ILLINOIS. VITAL COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS ARE ALSO IN PLACE AMONG VARIOUS HEALTH AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS, INCLUDING BRIGHT STAR COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND KELLY HALL YMCA, AMONG MANY MORE.

      "explanationText": "The communities served by NMHC hospitals are complex and diverse, encompassing rural, suburban and urban areas, with a range of socioeconomic statuses and social determinants of health that correspond to these demographics. NMHC is committed to providing care that takes into consideration the cultures and environments in which our patients live and is responsive to their needs. NMHC works closely with community partners, including health and social service partners, to identify priority health concerns and jointly develop community-based health initiatives designed to address healthcare disparities. Each NMHC hospital considers a variety of factors when defining its distinctive community. These factors include: geographic area served, principal functions of the hospital, areas of high hardship and the population served, the location of existing NM and community assets, and the service areas of other healthcare providers. By considering each of these factors, each NMHC hospital defined its own Community Service Area (CSA) and is working to meet the unique needs of the community it serves. Northwestern Memorial Hospital Service Area NMH serves a large, complex and diverse area with patients coming from the City of Chicago and surrounding counties. NMH's Hospital Service Area is defined as the Cities of Chicago and Evanston, which provides 69 percent of inpatient admissions. The community in NMH's Hospital Service Area is ethnically and racially diverse with large Black and Hispanic populations as well as large Polish and Spanish-speaking populations. Within NMH's Hospital Service Area, the population is expected to grow at a rate of 0.9 percent over the next five years. Significantly, nearly 20 percent of families live below the poverty level in NMH's Hospital Service Area. NMH is committed to providing culturally competent care that is responsive to the needs of all our patients, regardless of the ability to pay. NMH works with community health centers in some of Chicago's medically underserved areas to identify priority health concerns and jointly develop community-based health initiatives designed to address healthcare disparities. NMH defines its CSA as a seven-mile radius around the hospital, which includes 34 ZIP codes. Northwestern Medicine Lake Forest Hospital Service Area NM LFH primarily serves Lake County, which has a fairly stable population of around 704,000 residents; nearly 73 percent of inpatient admissions at NM LFH are derived from Lake County. While NM LFH's Hospital Service Area population is only expected to grow by 0.7 percent over the next five years, the over-65 population is growing rapidly. Between 2010 and 2015 (the most recent information available), the number of persons in Lake County 65 years and older increased by more than 2 percent. A total of 20.2% of Lake County residents are Hispanic or Latino. In looking at race independent of ethnicity, 78.7% of residents of Lake County are White and 14.4% are Black. NM LFH defines its community as Lake County in order to facilitate alignment with the Lake County Health Department (LCHD). Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital Service Area Located in Winfield, Illinois, NMCDH serves the residents of central and western DuPage County and beyond. NMCDH's Hospital Service Area accounts for 70 percent of inpatient admissions. Age distribution in the County includes 23.8 percent infants, children or adolescents (up 0.4 percent from the 2015 CHNA), 63.3 percent of residents are age 18 to 64 (up 1.1 percent), and the 12.9 percent of age 65 or older (up 0.6 percent). In looking at race independent of ethnicity, 79.4% of residents in DuPage County are White and 4.7% are Black. When considering ethnicity, 13.9% of DuPage residents are Hispanic or Latino. The county has a higher proportion of white residents and a lower proportion of black residents than the state and US. The percentage of Hispanic and Latino residents is also lower than found in the state and US. Northwestern Medicine Delnor Hospital Service Area NMDH primarily serves the residents of Kane County. Kane County is the seventh-youngest county in Illinois and notable for its age distribution. The median age remains 34.5 years as compared to the 2015 current Census Bureau average of 36.7 years. Those aged 18 to 24 comprise 61.1 percent of the population; 27.1 percent are age 0 to 17, and 11.7 percent are age 65 or older. Non-Hispanic whites now constitute 72.5 percent of the total population, an increase from 59 percent in the prior CHNA report, and Hispanics now comprise 31.4 percent of the total population. When compared to Illinois and the US in general, the proportion of Hispanics is double in Kane County, and the county has the largest proportion of Hispanics in the state. Northwestern Medicine Kishwaukee Hospital Service Area NMKH serves a majority of DeKalb County residents; the greater part of the county's residents live in the cities of DeKalb and Sycamore. The median age of DeKalb County residents is significantly lower than that of Illinois overall, at 30.3 years, or seven years less than the median age of an Illinois or US resident. 21.4 percent of residents are aged 20 to 29 years and 16.3 percent are aged from 10 to 19 years. Additionally, 11 percent of the population is aged 30 to 39, 11.8 percent comprises 40 to 49 years, 2.4 percent from 50 to 59 years, and 15.8 percent are over 60 years. The county population is 87 percent white, 8 percent black, 3 percent Asian and 2 percent is two or more races. When considering ethnicity, 11 percent of the population identified as Hispanic or Latino. Northwestern Medicine Valley West Hospital Service Area A critical access hospital in Sandwich, Illinois, NMVW primarily serves residents of DeKalb County, demographics as detailed with NMKH. NMVW's Hospital Service Area accounts for 72 percent of inpatient admissions. NM CDH, NM Delnor, NM Kishwaukee and NM Valley West define their CSA based on their Primary Service Area (PSA). The PSA is a contiguous set of ZIP codes within a defined geographical area that accounts for a majority percentage of inpatient admissions. Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital Service Area Located in Wheaton, Illinois, MRH largely serves the residents of DuPage County, demographics as discussed with regards to the NMCDH service area of DuPage County as well. However, due to the specialty nature of the hospital, MRH also serves as a destination hospital receiving patient referrals from surrounding counties including Cook, Will, Kane, Kendall, DeKalb and LaSalle. Due to the unique services offered by MRH, the hospital does not use a PSA to define its community. MRH considers DuPage County its CSA, but also serves as a destination hospital for surrounding counties. Patients often travel from Cook, Will, Kane, Kendall, DeKalb and LaSalle counties, among many more, to receive care at MRH. Northern Illinois Medical Center The hospitals comprising NIMC define their primary service area as McHenry County. The age distribution of the population was 29.5% aged 0-18, 56.5% aged 18-65, and 14.0% aged 65 and older as of the latest data available in 2017. McHenry County uninsured rates in 2017 were just 5.5% compared to the state uninsured rate of 7.8%. McHenry County also enjoys a relatively high socioeconomic status in comparison to the state at large, with median household income of $82,230 compared to the average $61,229. Together, the three NM hospitals in Chicago's northwest suburbs - NM McHenry, NM Huntley and NM Woodstock - serve the same CSA of McHenry County, which accounts for a majority of inpatient admissions.",
