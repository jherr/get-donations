This interpretation also clarifies the financial statement classification of tax-related penalties and interest and sets forth new disclosures regarding unrecognized tax benefits.

The hospital facility took into account input from persons who represent the community, including uninsured persons, low-income persons and minority groups, through community input surreys, community focus groups, healthcare and social service provider focus groups, and stakeholder assessments. Community input surveys collected input from 1,593 individuals 18 or older living in the NMH Community Service Area. Surveys were available on paper and online and were disseminated in four different languages. Questions assessed demographics, the health of the community, community strengths, opportunities for improvement and priority health needs. Surveys were targeted at priority populations, those typically underrepresented in assessment processes, including communities of color, immigrants, LGBTQ+ community members, individuals with disabilities and low-income communities. Community focus groups included 36 discussion sessions held within the NMH Community Service Area. Focus groups took place with priority populations, such as veterans, individuals living with mental illness, communities of color, older adults, caregivers, teens and young adults, LGBTQ+ community members, adults and teens experiencing homelessness, families with children, faith communities, adults with disabilities, and children and adults living with chronic conditions such as diabetes and asthma. Healthcare and social service provider focus groups assessed community leaders and healthcare providers, including faith leaders, immigrant service providers and hospitals. Stakeholder assessments evaluated trends, factors and events that currently affect or are anticipated to affect the public health system and included an assessment of the public health system's capacity to advance health equity. To ensure that organizations impacting health in the NMH community service area were meaningfully engaged in interpreting the findings of the CHNA, prioritizing the identified needs, and forming a collaborative plan to address priority needs, the Community Health Council was established and maintained, and the following community stakeholders were formally engaged: 1. Bright Star Community Outreach 2. Chicago Public Library 3. CommunityHealth 4. Erie Family Health Centers 5. Kelly Hall YMCA 6. Near North Health Services Corporation 7. Neighborhood Housing Services 8. Northwestern University's Alliance for Research in Chicagoland Communities 9. Salvation Army Freedom Center 10.

Through the tax year 2016-2019 prioritization process and implementation plan, NMH identified four Priority Health Needs: Access to Healthcare Services, Chronic Disease, Injury and Violence, and Mental Health. NMH identified health needs that would be best addressed through a coordinated response from a range of healthcare and community resources. Specific ways in which NMH is addressing the significant needs identified in its most recently conducted CHNA are defined as follows: Priority Need 1: Access to Healthcare Services: 1.1: Improve alignment of current NMH care coordination programs. Transitioning between care settings or providers can be especially difficult for medically complex and vulnerable patients. Recognizing the need to improve care coordination for our vulnerable populations, NMH developed the Innovations in Managing Patients Across Care Transitions (IMPACT) initiative in FY17. Aligned with our mission to put patients first, IMPACT is a collaboration of care transition programs that address the needs of our most medically and psychosocially complex patients. The collaboration is composed of seven distinct programs focused on managing patients across care transitions. Each IMPACT program focuses on a different patient population with unique individual needs. By building trusting relationships, identifying and addressing barriers, providing patient-centered comprehensive care, and connecting with community resources, IMPACT is able to sustain partnerships with our patients across the healthcare continuum. More than 9,900 patients have been connected with an IMPACT team since the start of the program. Patient demographics include: 1. Active patient: 1059 2. Overlapping patient: 335 3. Total patient: 9923 4. % Female: 45.1% 5. Average Age: 61 6. Average readmission risk score: .12 7. CMI: 2.50 8. Race- % Asian: 2.9% 9. Race- % Black 33.6% 10. Race- % Other: 9.3% 11. Race- % Unknown: 5.3% 12. Race- % White: 48.8% 13. Mortality rate: 13.2% Over the last year and a half, IMPACT collaborated with community-based organizations in Chicago in an effort to address the underlying social determinants of health that impact care coordination and to improve the health of our patients. One basic and powerful social determinant of health is access to safe, quality housing and the supports necessary to maintain that housing. To help address this need, in 2019 IMPACT collaborated on two housing pilots with the Center for Housing and Health (CHH) and Thresholds, which are Chicago-based social, mental health and housing service providers. Through these pilots, eligible patients in IMPACT are provided with supportive housing, ongoing case management and additional support services. This pilot linked six IMPACT patients experiencing homelessness to bridge housing and, to date, four of those patients have been transitioned to permanents, supportive housing. Operation Warm Blanket (OWB) was a one-year, joint pilot program between NMH, Thresholds, and Lawson House. In addition to operating OWB, funding provided by NMH supports two beds at Lawson House which are managed by Thresholds. Through this pilot, willing patients are brought to NMH's Transitional Care clinic from the emergency department for an intake assessment, warm breakfast and an introduction to the clinic. Thresholds staff then screen patients for housing at the Lawson House and supplement or follow up on emergency department social work referrals to shelters, food pantries, soup kitchens, clothing outlets, substance use treatment programs and community mental health resources. Since the initiative launched in February of 2019, 107 patient encounters have occurred across 20 OWB sessions. This includes 51 unique patients (51 new visits and 56 return visits), with 32 males and 19 females with an average age of 49.53 years old (minimum age 21, maximum age 79). 1.2: Assess and implement information technology (IT) solutions to improve care coordination for Medicaid patients through the Emergency Department (ED). Vulnerable populations required a diverse set of clinical and social services. The inability to address these needs has proven to lead to unnecessary emergency department utilization and preventable readmissions for patients. NMH identified the need for an easy-to-use, standardized, and measureable solution to increase access to social services and improve care coordination. In FY17, NowPow was selected as NMH's IT solution to improve care coordination and connect patients to reliable community resources. NowPow has the ability to identify and assess patients at high-risk for social needs, keep an accurate, accessible list of community and system-based resources, develop a process through the EMR to facilitate bidirectional referrals with community-based organizations, and analyze the effectiveness of these referrals and their impact on patient outcomes. In 2019, teams met to identify physicians, social workers and nurses from a variety of departments such as geriatrics, intensive case management, women's health, emergency department, transitional care, inpatient units and care coordination. These users completed a training and began to refer and track patients which included receiving confirmation of appointment completion with health partners such as CommunityHealth and Near North Health Services Corporation. 1.3: Continued innovation and process improvement to reduce barriers (such as office hours) relating to access to care for medically underserved populations. NMH has longstanding relationships with major federally qualified health centers (FQHC) and a free health clinic within the City of Chicago: Erie Family Health Centers (Erie), Near North Health Services Corporation (Near North) and CommunityHealth. NMH provides grant funding and care coordination to each of these organizations to support expanded access to health services for underserved patients in Chicago and the surrounding areas. Through support from NMH, Erie, Near North and CommmunityHealth are able to enhance their efforts to provide quality care in a local and culturally competent setting. This includes expanded access to clinical care, improved care coordination, and Education-Centered Medical Home (ECMH) student clinics. An ECMH embeds teams of medical students into primary care, community-based clinics to care for a panel of complex patients over time. The ECMH model serves the dual purpose of increasing the capacity of community clinics as well as providing early and comprehensive educational exposure to team-based medicine in an authentic outpatient environment. In collaboration with Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, NMH underwrote the cost of ECMHs at Erie, Near North and CommunityHealth. Through our collaborations with community health services providers, NMH learned that the greatest need of patients receiving care in the community setting is often access to subspecialty care and diagnostic services. To help address this need, much of the care provided to our patients who have been referred from a community partner is now provided by our physician groups. By building capacity for community organizations to provide primary care, while simultaneously increasing access to subspecialty care and diagnostic services at our physician groups, these collaborations ensure that the patient receives quality, efficient care in the most appropriate setting. Many patients who are referred to NMH for care from our community affiliations receive free or substantially discounted services. In FY18, there were 23,421 encounters from FQHC partners. To enhance access to this care, NMHC continues to refine processes to make the transition of patients from community organizations to NMHC entities more efficient and to continue to incorporate presumptive eligibility requirements. 1.4: Collaborate with external workgroups and agencies to support efforts that increase access to care. Together with AHE, NMH partnered with external organizations to advance health equity and wellness through strategies that address pressing issues in our communities to achieve greater collective impact. NMH participated on the AHE Access to Care committee to support efforts that reduce barriers and increase access to health care and community resources. Efforts focused on transportation as a barrier to care and strategies for MH to increase transportation to increase access.</ExplanationTxt>

        <ExplanationTxt>Facility , 2 - NORTHWESTERN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL. Priority Need 2: Chronic Disease (Diabetes, Heart Disease, Stroke, and Obesity): 2.1: Continue to support and expand diagnostic and specialty care services related to stroke. Launched in 2013, the Northwestern Medicine Telestroke Network now provides direct access to board-certified vascular neurologists via dedicated telemedicine technology 24 hours per day, every day of the year. There are seven NM Telestroke Network hospitals in the Chicagoland area - NM LFH (Lake Forest and Grayslake), Northwest Community Hospital, CGH Medical Center, Weiss Memorial Hospital, Swedish Covenant Hospital, Loretto Hospital and Saint Anthony Hospital. Expansion of the NM Telestroke Network is planned for 2019 and beyond. 2.2: Continue to support community health partner efforts to reduce the rate of heart disease, diabetes and obesity. NMH continued work to improve coordination of care for heart disease and stroke through strengthened high-quality, patient-centered medical homes. Programs such as the Keep Your Heart Healthy (KYHH) initiative were designed to identify Chicago residents most at risk for developing heart disease and work on an individual basis to empower those individuals to make lifestyle changes to reduce their health risks. This free program links individuals with healthcare services and medical homes through referrals in an effort to control health risk factors. Northwestern University's Institute for Public Health and Medicine (IPHAM) led the program, which was funded in part by grant funding from NMH. In June of 2018, a pragmatic evaluation was conducted of the reach, adoption, implementation, effectiveness and cost of the KYHH program. The evaluation found that from August 2013 through December 2016, KYHH reached 48,862 community residents through 1,534 screening events held in 27 Chicago community areas. 2.3: Continue to support and expand the Healthy Community Initiative. The Humboldt Park Healthy Community Initiative (HCI) was developed in collaboration with community organizations to improve the health of the residents of Humboldt Park based on the specific needs and challenges of the community, which include limited health literacy, violence, cultural beliefs and language barriers. The model was grounded in improved access to health information as well as safe, convenient and affordable options for learning about nutrition and engaging in physical activity in an effort to impact chronic disease. In FY19, the HCI committee promoted healthy lifestyle behaviors through free nutrition programs, physical activity classes, and wellness events to the residents of Humboldt Park. A wide-range of complimentary fitness classes were available to all community members. Classes included Hip-Hop Aerobics, Line Dancing, Adult Fitness, Youth Fitness, Zumba, Chair Aerobics for Seniors and Stepping. Classes typically ran two times per week, and from January to September of 2019, there were 4,818 participants. In addition, in FY2019, there were 32 monthly nutrition programs and 12 class series that reached 592 participants; 3 health and resource fairs that reached approximately 400 participants at each even; and 15 farmers markets that reached approximately 711 attendees. Priority Need 3: Injury and Violence: 3.1: Continue to utilize and seek effective models for ensuring victims of violent trauma have clinical and mental health support following ED or inpatient hospital-based care. NMH continued to partner with Cure Violence, previously known as CeaseFire, an organization founded in Chicago, to reduce retaliatory actions following violent trauma. As one of only five level I trauma centers in Chicago, NMH provides care to hundreds of Chicago residents who have violence-related traumatic injuries each year. NMH pays an annual fee to Cure Violence and integrates its intervention services into the treatment protocol for appropriate violent trauma cases. Trained "violence interrupters" meet with violent trauma victims and their families at NMH and attempt to defuse feelings of anger as well as discourage victims and their families from retaliating. The violence interrupters work in tandem with violence interrupters in the victim's home community. 3.2: Participate in community-led efforts to address violence. The Urban Resilience Network (TURN) Model (formerly known as the Bronzeville Dream Center) offers a bridge to mental health services and focuses on the five core competencies of counseling, workforce, parenting, mentorship and advocacy, which collectively focus on reducing violence and providing opportunities to the residents of Greater Bronzeville. TURN utilizes local faith leaders to implement evidence-based programs based on the NATAL-Israel Trauma model and the Communities That Care (CTC) model. Over the last five years, NMH has played an active role in developing the TURN Model. In addition to providing over $900,000 in direct funding, NMH provided leadership and knowledge-transfer, convened community support, established governance and operational structures, and supported fundraising efforts, including the development of grant applications. The TURN Model Trauma Counseling Program offers a bridge to mental health services. TURN utilizes local faith and community leaders to implement evidence-based programs based on the NATAL-Israel Trauma model and the Communities That Care (CTC) model. Since BSCO successfully launched its Trauma Helpline in July 2017, there have been over 500 unique callers. In 2019, BSCO continued to build capacity, including training a second cohort of faith and community leaders capable of staffing the Trauma Helpline. Additionally, BSCO worked with CPS Network 9, Chicago Police Department (CPD) and funeral staff, and other neighborhood entities to build resilience and trauma-informed counseling within the community. Priority Need 4: Mental Health: 4.1: Implement behavioral healthcare services within the primary care setting. NMH implemented a pilot program, based on the Collaborative Care Model, to strengthen the linkage between primary care and mental health in an effort to improve access and reduce obstacles to receiving mental health services. The program brings psychiatric care to patients by embedding behavioral health screenings and services within the primary care setting. If the patient is a fit for the program based on depression screening scores and symptoms, the primary care physician (PCP) refers the patient to the behavioral health care manager (BHCM) who coordinates treatment with the consulting psychiatrist and communicates the plan to both the PCP and the patient. The team is in constant communication to address the patients' symptoms, medications, and progress. The goal for the program's patients is to get to remission which is defined as having minimal to no symptoms of depression. Success of the program was defined as an increase in access to depression treatment within the primary care setting, as well as a reduced wait-time to be seen by a behavioral health resource. In FY18, NMH branded the collaborative care model as the Collaborative Behavioral Health Program (CBHP), and prepared to expand the program to additional sites throughout the health system. New processes were developed for a more robust data collection and analysis system. This process is currently being implemented and will ultimately produce the following metrics: 1. Patients with Depression Diagnosis 2. Patients Referred to Program- Depression 3. Patient Enrolled in Program- Depression 4. Actively Engaged in Program- Depression 5. Length of Stay in CBHP- Graduated 6. Positive Response 7. Qualified for Graduation- Still in CBHP 8. Return CBHP Patients 9. Depression Screening and Follow-Up Plan for Primary Care 10. Appropriateness of Referral- PCP screened patient with PHQ-9 prior to referral 11. Monthly Outreach In FY2019, NM was the first academic medical center to bill for Collaborative Care Management. Billing for these services will allow CBHP to expand and increase access to behavioral health care.</ExplanationTxt>

        <ExplanationTxt>Facility , 3 - NORTHWESTERN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL. 4.2: Evaluate the feasibility of co-locating primary care and mental health services within the outpatient psychiatry clinic to increase alignment with best practices in mental health care. In 2017, NMH provided funding and began work to evaluate the feasibility of offering primary care services within the Norman and Ida Stone Institute of Psychiatry outpatient clinic. The goal of this initiative was to improve access to primary care and care coordination for individuals with serious and persistent mental illness; to promote healthy lifestyles including counseling on healthy eating, exercise, and tobacco cessation; and to implement guideline-based screening for common medical disorders in a chronically mentally ill population. In 2018, the team established operations, identified metrics, and secured necessary equipment such as exam tables, blood pressure cuffs, and other medical supplies. The pilot launched in January 2019 and focused on increased primary care coordination for individuals with serious mental illness. NMH anticipates increased access and engagement around preventable cardiac disease risk factors such as weight reduction, tobacco cessation and lipid control will enhance the overall health and well-being among this patient population. 4.3: Increase access to mental health services (such as counseling and education programs) through the TURN model, a Bright Star Community Outreach initiative. From the time of inception, TURN has assisted 573 callers on the helpline. This service includes successful discharges and referrals to additional mental health services. In addition, BSCO continued to break down related barriers and de-stigmatize trauma and counseling through education and advocacy work. Continued growth and expansion of services offered by BSCO is expected over the next few years. NMH is committed to BSCO's mission and the TURN Model initiative. We will continue to support BSCO with dedicated funding, public health and mental health resources, and administrative support, and will continue to help plan for the delivery of mental health services. 4.4: Advocate for adequate mental health services and reimbursement. NMH engages in advocacy efforts aimed at increasing access to behavioral health services. Through AHE's Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders committee, NMH worked with other community healthcare leaders to implement strategies to address the most pressing issues in the community. As part of the collaborative, NMH worked to identify gaps and opportunities to implement Mental health First Aid training, and engaged in the development of an awareness campaign to address stigma surrounding mental health. 4.5: Collaborate with external workgroups and agencies to support efforts that impact mental health NMH continued its partnership with Calm Classroom (CC) to provide mindfulness strategies to youth in our communities. NMH engaged CC, the largest provider of school-wide mindfulness programming in the U.S., to teach mindfulness practices to students in Chicago Public Schools (CPS) Network 9. Network 9 schools are primarily located in Bronzeville, a neighborhood on Chicago's South Side that is plagued by persistent, high rates of violence. CC offers accessible mindfulness techniques that help promote self-awareness, mental focus and emotional resilience in the classroom setting. In FY19, the collaboration between NMH, CC and CPS Network 9 served more than 5,000 CPS students and their teachers at eight schools and one community-based organization. Through their train-the-trainer model, CC equipped CPS teachers with mindfulness techniques that can be taught in three minutes in the classroom. These practices supplement CPS's trauma-informed approach to creating supportive schools. Following implementation of the mindfulness practices, teachers who engaged in the program were surveyed and reported a positive impact on their students. In FY19, 96 percent of teachers reported teaching CC techniques between 1-3 times per day; 90 percent reported their students seem calmer; 89 percent reported their students were more engaged and ready to learn; 76 percent reported that their students were better able to regulate emotions; 81 percent believed the culture and the climate in their classroom had improved; and 51percent practice CC techniques outside of school; 65 percent report that CC made them feel more engaged in teaching; 78 percent report that CC has helped them understand the importance of self-care; and 71 percent report that CC has given them tools to manage stress more effectively. Non-Priority Areas: The CHNA report identified areas of opportunity for health improvement for which NMH and the external steering committee (ESC) determined it would not prepare an implementation plan and strategy. These areas of opportunity and the reasons for not addressing are below. Cancer: NMH provides a comprehensive range of clinical services to treat and screen for cancer.

Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital took into account input from persons who represent the broad interests of the community served by the hospital facility, including those with special knowledge of or expertise in public health. Input was collected for the CHNA through a community survey and a focus group, both conducted by the Lake County Health Department and Community Health Center, and through conversations with key stakeholders between April 2018 and October 2018. The survey was randomly distributed to 5,000 Lake County households in early 2018. The focus group was conducted with the Lake County Community Health Worker Partnership, a partnership between Mano a Mano and the Waukegan Public Library. Fifteen community health workers who are trained to deliver health education on a myriad of topics ranging chronic disease to mental health to benefit navigation, were interviewed about community health strengths, weaknesses, and potential improvement opportunities in their communities. These community health workers are uniquely situated to provide input from a nuanced perspective, one as a resident of the community and one as a representative of the Partnership. In March 2019, NM LFH also developed a survey tool to formally solicit input from organizations who are representative of the assessed community area, including those who serve medically underserved, low income and minority populations, to begin the process of ranking priority health needs (defined as health needs that could be impacted the most by the work of NMLFH and partner organizations).

        <ExplanationTxt>Facility , 1 - NORTHWESTERN LAKE FOREST HOSPITAL. Through the tax year 2016-2019 prioritization process and implementation plan, Northwestern Medicine Lake Forest Hospital (NMLFH) identified three priority health to be addressed through collaborative planning and coordinated action with organizations that impact health services in our community. Priority 1: Access to Healthcare 1.1: Increase capacity to provide quality medical care to underserved communities through the construction of a new hospital NMLFH is committed to improving the health of Lake County. By emphasizing healthy lifestyles and primary and preventative care at a medical home, we can reduce overall healthcare expenditures and improve the health of our communities. Since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the uninsured rate in Lake County has drop to nearly 6%, with many of the newly insured coming through Illinois's Medicaid expansion. However, despite becoming insured, many barriers to care continue to exist including appointment availability, phantom provider networks, and lack of specialty and sub-specialty care. 1.2: Providing targeted, community centered vaccination clinics for school-aged youth. Immunizations are one of our greatest defense against many serious illnesses. In the state of Illinois, all students entering, transferring, or advancing into kindergarten through 12th grades are required to show proof of receipt of 2 doses of mumps and 2 doses of rubella vaccine. In addition, students entering, transferring, or advancing into kindergarten, 6th, or 9th grades are required to show proof of receipt of 2 doses of varicella vaccine. If students cannot are not vaccinated or do not show proof or exemption, they are excluded from school until they are able to meet the requirements. According to the Illinois State Board of Education's most recent statistics (2018-2019), in the North Chicago School District 187, over 6 percent of the student population was excluded from school due to lack of vaccination compliance. NMLFH is helping address the need for access to vaccines for school-aged children North Chicago. Working in collaboration with The Grainger Foundation, North Chicago Community Partners, and the North Chicago School District 187, NMLFH provided funding for, and has worked to develop, an efficient way to administer vaccines to elementary age children to ensure they are prepared to start the new school year. In FY2019 NMLFH began administering Tdap and MMR vaccinations to children in this school district. NMLFH administered 24 vaccinations, free of charge, in FY19, accounting for nearly 10 percent of the excluded population. Additionally, nearly 60 students received free school physicals. Continued expansion of the program is planned in FY20. 1.3: Provide transportation assistance to medically underserved patients. Transportation barriers are often cited in northern Lake County as a barrier to accessing quality and timely medical care. This barrier may lead to missed appointments, delayed care, or people not seeking care in the first place, and often forces people to wait hours for a bus that may not run routinely in order to get around. Consequences of lack of transportation can manifest in poorer management of chronic disease and poorer health outcomes. This social determinant of health mainly affects the poorer population in northern Lake County who may face additional barrier to care including access to insurance, language barriers, and cost. Because these patients are often seeking care at a local clinics, NMLFH partnered with a local federally qualified health center (FQHC), Erie HealthCenter Waukegan, and Lyft, the ride share transportation company, to provide transportation vouchers to patients without access to a vehicle. NMLFH continues to seek innovative relationships with transportation partners to address this community need. A pilot project was launched with Kaizen Health, a healthcare logistics and non-emergency medical transportation (NEMT) platform, to provide transportation to patients who otherwise would not be able to receive needed medical care. In the two-month pilot, 35 patients received transportation to medical care. Expansion of this relationship is planned for FY20. Priority 2: Heart Disease and Stroke 2.1: Continuing to support and expand diagnostic and specialty care services related to stroke Stroke is the leading cause of disability and the fifth-leading cause of death in the United States according to the American Stroke Association. When a patient is suffering a stroke, every minute counts. Thanks to advances in technology, patients with stroke symptoms can now be rapidly assessed by a neurologist 24/7, even if the specialist is physically located many miles away. The Northwestern Medicine telestroke program features a two-way video and audio system that allows a board-certified neurologist from the comprehensive stroke centers at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital to conduct a virtual physical exam and to collaborate with the emergency medicine teams at area hospitals. The Northwestern Medicine telestroke program is offered to several hospitals in Illinois, including Northwestern Medicine Lake Forest Hospital. The videoconferencing system connects the neurologist and patient through a secure internet connection. Using the camera, the neurologist can perform observational tests, such as gauging how a patient's pupils respond to light sources and monitoring how well the patient can move and speak. Simultaneously, through the electronic medical record, the neurologist has instant access to the patient's medical information, including vital signs, CT scans and lab results. In FY19, our NMLFH conducted 212 telestroke consultations and the Northwestern Medicine Grayslake Outpatient Center conducted 62 telestroke consultations. 2.2: Supporting a legislative agenda to address health risk behaviors including tobacco use policies Tobacco kills over 480,000 people each year, more than automobile crashes, gun violence and opiate overdoses combined and the developing teenage brain is particularly vulnerable to the effects of nicotine. In Lake County, 14 percent of residents are considered smokers. However, according to the most recent Illinois Youth Survey, youth tobacco use has doubled since 2010 with 31 percent of 12th graders having used an e-cigarette in the past 12 months. Medical efforts to address youth tobacco use have not been effective as rates continue to climb. Literature shows that the most effective interventions to curb youth tobacco use have been to raise the minimum legal sales age of tobacco products from 18 to 21. More than 95% of addicted smokers start before age 21. This intervention has been shown to decrease youth tobacco use in other communities and so it was adopted as a course of action by the Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Action Team as part of the Live Well Lake County Steering Committee. Through this action team, NMLFH has worked with local home-rule communities within Lake County to pass legislation raising the minimum legal sales age of tobacco products from 18 to 21. * Between September 2018 and June 2019, four additional communities raised the minimum legal sales age of tobacco products from 18 to 21. o The total population covered by new tobacco 21 legislation was almost 150,000 people. o The total population under age 18 covered by new tobacco 21 legislation was almost 37,000 people. * In July 2019, the Lake County Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Action Team helped bring about Illinois legislative change with the passing of Illinois Tobacco 21, which raised the minimum legal sales age of tobacco products from 18-21 across all communities in Lake County. All 703,000 people in Lake County are now covered by this law.</ExplanationTxt>

        <ExplanationTxt>Facility , 2 - NORTHWESTERN LAKE FOREST HOSPITAL. 2.3: Promotion of physical activity through Go Lake County expansion The benefits of physical activity are well known: increased cardiovascular fitness; reduced risk of heart disease and stroke; improved management of conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol and, diabetes; increased muscle strength; and reduced body fat. Joining a gym is a barrier for many that makes staying active difficult, especially through long winter months. In FY17, through the Be Active: Walking Action Team as part of the Live Well Lake County Steering Committee, NMLFH worked to create the Go Lake County initiative. GO Lake County is a walking initiative that promotes healthy and active living through programing and events within Lake County communities. GO enables everyone in Lake County to increase their level of daily physical activity and foster community engagement. GO events or programs are open to everyone in Lake County and are intended to be free. In FY18, NMLFH supported expansion of Go Lake County programming. * In FY19, the number of communities with active Go Lake County park districts and partnerships grew to 22. * Nearly 100 community led walks were held across Lake County. * Over 4,100 people across those communities were able to attend free walking events increasing physical activity. Priority 3: Mental health disorders and substance abuse 3.1: Expansion of psychiatric services Since FY16, NMLFH has seen a significant increase in behavioral health inpatient and emergency department patient volume. NMLFH seeks solutions that can be implemented in parallel to system planning, thereby offering these patients treatment in the appropriate care settings based on their diagnosis. After discharge from the hospital, outpatient care was needed to close the loop on referral visits. In FY19, NMLFH added additional psychiatric staff to provide behavioral health services, increasing capacity in our community. New outpatient and consultation clinic visits have increased with the onboarding of new providers. * Hired 1 new psychiatrist * 23% increase in unique patient visits 3.2: Evaluate the feasibility of implementing behavioral healthcare services within the primary care setting. Due to insurance limitations, a nationwide shortage of psychiatrists, and a tendency for patients to see their primary care physician for mood disorders, psychiatric care may not be pursued as often as it should be. In response, NMLFH began work to evaluate the feasibility of offering behavioral healthcare services within the primary care setting, based on the Collaborative Care Model, to strengthen the linkage between primary care and mental health in an effort to improve access and reduce obstacles to receiving mental health services. The program brings psychiatric care to patients by embedding behavioral health screenings and services within the primary care setting. If the patient is a fit for the program based on depression screening scores and symptoms, the primary care physician (PCP) refers the patient to the behavioral health care manager (BHCM) who coordinates treatment with the consulting psychiatrist and communicates the plan to both the PCP and the patient. The team is in constant communication to address the patients' symptoms, medications, and progress. Treatment provided in the program is outcomes-oriented. The goal for the program's patients is to get to remission which is defined as having minimal to no symptoms of depression. Success of the program was defined as an increase in access to depression treatment within the primary care setting, as well as a reduced wait-time to be seen by a behavioral health resource. The pilot will launch in FY20, and will focus on increased behavioral health care coordination for individuals within the primary care setting. We anticipate that increased access and engagement will enhance the overall health and well-being among this patient population. If the pilot proves successful, NMLFH will seek to roll this clinical intervention out to its various outpatient primary care clinics. 3.3: Drug education and prevention programming with students in our local schools, and with parents in our local community through Text-A-Tip NMLFH supports Lake Forest LEAD, a local non-profit organization dedicated to the promotion of healthy family relationships and the prevention of alcohol, drug use, and other risky behavior by youth. LEAD has served the Lake Forest, Lake Bluff, and Knollwood, IL communities for nearly 30 years. There are a variety of long-term issues that LEAD is seeking to address, including underage drinking and drug abuse; prevention of prescription, over-the-counter and illegal drug abuse by youth and adults; promotion of mental health and wellness; reducing stigma related to depression and other mental health issues; and the prevention of suicide. A significant and successful strategy in the NMFLH and LEAD partnership has been the 24/7 anonymous text crisis line, Text-A-Tip. LEAD has seen a dramatic increase in the number of people who benefit from its programming, both in our local Lake Forest and Lake Bluff community and across the nation. LEAD has conducted trainings, programs and workshops in nearly 20 states over the past two years, and our Text-A-Tip hotline is now accessible to over 7 million people, almost doubling in scope since this time last year, and including the entirety of Lake and McHenry Counties in Illinois. Finally, LEAD's online and social media presence has seen an increase of over 500% in the past 3 years. Text-A-Tip is now available to over 7 million people nationwide. Text-A-Tip has been able to deliver wellness checks and emergency personnel to teens in crisis, and has led to interventions in suicide and self-harm situations, violence situations, and situations of drug overdose. Aside from the actual lives saved to date, the resource allows students a 24/7 place to turn when they are in need of emotional support. It is safe, anonymous, and always available. NON-PRIORITY AREAS The CHNA report identified areas of opportunity for health improvement for which NMLFH and the external steering committee (ESC) determined it would not prepare an implementation plan and strategy. These areas of opportunity and the reasons for not addressing are below. Cancer: NMLFH provides a comprehensive range of clinical services to treat and screen for cancer. NMLFH will continue to sustain these services and work to strengthen community-based outreach both through the internal oncology department and through community partners. The ESC recommended focusing efforts on other health conditions for which NMLFH could have a greater impact. Diabetes: NMLFH provides clinical services to treat diabetes and will continue to sustain these services. While there is a lot of crossover between the preventable conditions that cause Diabetes and those that cause Heart Disease and Stroke, the ESC recommended focusing efforts on other health conditions for which NMLFH could have a greater impact. Community work will continue through participation on the Diabetes Prevention and Management Action Team as part of the Live Well Lake County Steering Committee. Immunization &amp; Infectious Diseases: NMLHH provides clinical services to treat pneumonia, asthma, and tuberculosis, as well as other infectious diseases. The ESC recommended that NMLHH focus on strengthening and improving access to medical homes, where preventive care and screening services can be effectively coordinated and access to medically necessary specialty care can be facilitated. Injury &amp; Violence: NMLFH will work to strengthen community-based outreach both through community partnerships to affect injury and violence. The ESC recommended focusing efforts on other determinants for which NMLFH could have a greater impact. Nutrition, Physical Activity &amp; Weight: NMLFH provides clinical services, nutritional counseling, and weight loss programming for patients and will continue to sustain these services. While there is a lot of crossover between these behaviors and those that cause Heart Disease and Stroke, the ESC recommended focusing efforts on other health conditions for which NMLFH could have a greater impact. Community work will continue through participation on the various Action Teams as part of the Live Well Lake County Steering Committee. Potentially Disabling Conditions: NMLFH provides comprehensive rehabilitation services including physical, speech, and occupational therapy for patients. The ESC recommended focusing efforts on other health conditions for which NMLFH could have a greater impact. Tobacco Use: NMLFH supports public policies aimed at reducing tobacco use. NMLFH also offers a comprehensive Smoking Cessation Program, facilitated by an American Lung Association certified instructor. The ESC recommended focusing efforts on other health conditions for which NMLFH could have a greater impact.</ExplanationTxt>

To solicit input from key informants, those individuals who have a broad interest in the health of the community, an Online Key Informant Survey was implemented as part of the CHNA process. A list of recommended participants was provided by NMCDH; this list included names and contact information for physicians, public health representatives, other health professionals, social service providers, and a variety of other community leaders. Potential participants were chosen because of their ability to identify primary concerns of the population with whom they work, as well as of the community overall. Key informants were contacted by email, introducing the purpose of the survey and providing a link to take the survey online. Reminder emails were sent as needed to increase participation. In all, 41 community stakeholders took part in the Online Key Informant Survey including representatives of the organizations below: 1. DuPage County Health Department 2. DuPage Federation on Human Services Reform 3. DuPagePads 4. American Cancer Society 5. B.R. Ryall YMCA of Northwestern DuPage County 6. Bartlett Park District 7.

In the online survey, key informants were asked to rate the degree to which various health issues are a problem in their own community. Follow-up questions asked them to describe why they identify problem areas as such and how these might be better addressed. Findings represent qualitative rather than quantitative data. The Online Key Informant Survey was designed to gather input from participants regarding their opinions and perceptions of the health of the residents in the area. Therefore, these findings are based on perceptions, not facts. To ensure that organizations impacting health in DuPage County were meaningfully engaged in reviewing and interpreting the findings of the CHNA, developing priorities among the identified needs and forming a collaborative plan to address the top priority needs, the External Steering Committee (ESC) was established and maintained.</ExplanationTxt>

Through the prioritization process, NMCDH identified three Priority Health Needs: Access to Healthcare Services, Chronic Disease, and Mental Health. NMCDH identified health needs that would be best addressed through a coordinated response from a range of healthcare and community resources. Specific ways in which NMCDH is addressing the significant needs identified in its most recently conducted CHNA are defined as follows: Priority 1: Mental Health Mental health and physical health are closely connected. Mental health plays an integral role in the ability to maintain physical health. Mental illnesses, such as depression, anxiety and addiction, affect people's ability to participate in health promoting behaviors. Subsequently, the presence of mental health problems can have a serious impact on chronic disease and decrease the ability to participate in treatment and recovery. To address the identified health needs related to Mental Health and Substance Abuse, NMCDH and members of the External Steering Committee plan to collaborate on the following strategies: 1.1 Continue strategic planning efforts to evaluate the demand for hospital-based mental health services and identify appropriate NMCDH resources to address those needs. A comprehensive strategic plan is being developed to properly address the mental health needs of the NMCDH and Northwestern Medicine Delnor Hospital service areas. The plan continued to identify the needs and develop strategies to address those needs, including but not limited to expansion of inpatient behavioral health and addiction services and additional capacity in the outpatient mental health service line. 1.2 Provide Community Benefit Grant funding and further solidify relationships with community agencies that can provide outpatient mental health services to the medically underserved residents within the service area. Grants were provided to NAMI DuPage, Ecker Center, Samara Care and World Relief Meier Clinic Foundation. The following outcomes were reported: NAMI DuPage Education and Resources Services grant outcomes: 1. Over 80% of participants reported a decrease in stigma and stated they felt more hopeful for recovery; 2. 99.5% of the participants report increased awareness of resources and knowledge to help themselves and their loved ones; 3. Over 90% of participants reported increased knowledge of mental illness and hope for recovery. Ecker Center grant outcomes: 1. Medication Possession Ratio: baseline is 0.89 and it was measured to be consistently a .92 over the grant period; 2. Clients' symptoms improvement baseline is 72% and it was measured that 90% of clients reports symptom improvement. Meier Clinics Foundation grant outcomes: 1. 100% of Naomi's House residents self-identified that healing has begun in their lives since participating in the program; 2. Utilization of Basis 2 pre- and post- clinical outcome testing: Percent Increase Overall: 67%, Substance Abuse: 0%, Psychosis: 100%, Self-Harm: 0%, Emotional Lability: 29%, Interpersonal Problems: 50%, Depression/Functioning: 73% Individuals impacted by funding from the Samara Care: Mental Health Access Program reported: (NMCDH/NMDH) 1. 87% of clients experienced an increase in their GAF scale score; 2. 90% of those who completed the client satisfaction survey indicated that they agree/strongly agree, "I feel I was able to accomplish what I set out to do," "I am better able to handle conflict and stress." 3. 95% of those who completed the client satisfaction survey indicated that they agree/strongly agree, "My counselor interventions and interactions were helpful." Outcomes reported as the result of NMCDH funding to the World Relief Refugee Wellness Program: (NMCDH/NMDH) 1. 8% of participants were able to identify symptoms of mental illness; 2. 75% were to identify at least 3 helpful mainstream community resources and report stronger connectedness to members of their own community; 3. 68% of refugees receiving mental health treatment demonstrated an increased level of functioning, decreased symptoms and completed treatment goals 1.3: Participate in and support initiatives within Kane County that are focused on Mental Health. The Kane County Health Department is currently developing a Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) in collaboration with the hospitals and community agencies within the county. One of the identified priorities to be addressed is Mental Health and Substance Abuse. NMCDH will continue to participate in the CHIP Executive Committee and the Mental Health Subgroup to develop and implement the action plan to address the health priority of Mental Health and Substance Abuse. 1.4: Complete the planning phase and implement the Mental Health First Aid Program in the NMCDH service area. The Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) program is designed to teach residents of the community how to take action when a mental illness is suspected or identified. The intent is to reduce the wide reach and economic toll that mental health disorders and crises have on the community. Individuals within NMCDH are currently completing training and the certification process and will begin providing educational sessions to teach parents, family members, caregivers, teachers, school staff, peers and community members how to help an adolescent or adult experiencing a mental health or addiction challenge or crisis. These individuals can then intervene and direct the individual to appropriate resources. The overall goal is to increase awareness and early intervention to those in need of behavioral health services. One NMCDH/NMDH staff was trained to offer the nationally recognized evidence-based Mental Health First Aid program. 1. 18 classes were held; 2. 271 individuals attended the programs; 3. 100% of MHFA participants scored a minimum of 85% on the MHFA course exam. Priority 2: Chronic Disease Chronic conditions are responsible for 70% of deaths and 75% of healthcare spending. Chronic disease is a leading cause of disability and lost income. Chronic disease disproportionally affects low-income and minority populations. In the NMCDH service area, 35% of adults have been told that they have high blood pressure; 30% have been told they have a high cholesterol reading; 23% are obese; and chronic diseases of the heart are the second leading cause of death. To address the identified deficiencies in Chronic Disease, NMCDH and members of the External Steering Committee plan to collaborate on the following strategies: 2.1: Provide resources and tools to patients diagnosed with heart failure in order to improve self-management skills and quality of life. NMCDH continued to provide a post-discharge community-based heart failure program designed to improve the quality of life and decrease readmission rates for patients diagnosed with heart failure. Efforts to improve the coordination of care for heart failure patients were expanded, and a system of referrals for specialty care and social service needs were implemented. A retrospective study of outcomes related to the program was completed to ensure maximum quality is achieved. Key outcomes of this program were: 366 individuals were enrolled in the Community-Based Heart Failure program: (NMCDH/NMDH) 1. 30-day readmission rate for heart failure diagnosis: 1% (markedly below the national rate); 2. 99% of clients demonstrated the ability to identify appropriate action in the event of a worsening of their condition; 3. 96% of clients utilized an effective medication management system; 4. 89% of clients demonstrated compliance with symptom tracking.</ExplanationTxt>

NMCDH provided community education related to chronic disease in the areas of evidence-based primary interventions (disease prevention, health promotion), evidence-based secondary interventions (screening) and evidence-based tertiary interventions (education to individuals affected with a chronic disease in an effort to promote an optimum state of individual wellness). Programmatic venues included the CATCH (Coordinated Approach to Child Health) program, the Dinner with the Doc series, clinician-led educational offerings, self-help groups, rehabilitation service programs and support programs. A comprehensive plan to increase patient compliance with physician and ancillary staff referrals to smoking cessation resources was also investigated and developed. Community Benefit Grants were also be provided to agencies that provide programming related to the priority health need of chronic disease. Key outcomes of these interventions include: 1. A total of two educational seminars were offered in the areas of cardiovascular health. A total of 277 individuals attended these seminars. (NMCDH/NMDH combined data.) 2. Meeting space was provided at no charge for 20 support groups. (NMCDH/NMDH) 3. A total of three educational seminars were offered in the areas of cancer.

A total of 994 car seats were checked / distributed (NMCDH/NMDH) Priority 3: Access to Care An aging population, coupled with a challenging economy and an increasing prevalence of chronic disease, create access-to-care issues relating to both the affordability and availability of care. NMCDH seeks to promote access through a variety of initiatives identified below. NMCDH will continue to work with individuals and families to promote access to medically necessary services by maintaining an accessible financial assistance program. Additionally, staff and leadership will work collaboratively with key community partners to promote a seamless continuum of care into local medical home settings. To improve Access to Health Services, NMCDH and members of the External Steering Committee plan to collaborate on the following strategies: 3.1: Strengthen and increase patient affiliation with high-quality patient-centered medical homes. NMCDH and its partners from the External Steering Committee focused efforts on strengthening the care coordination, availability, cultural competency and offerings available at the patient-centered medical homes operated by the Federally Qualified Health Centers and healthcare organizations that are closely aligned with Northwestern Medicine Delnor Hospital. By concentrating efforts on improving the most essential community-based component of the healthcare system - the patient-centered medical home - NMCDH focused on ensuring patients receive timely and appropriate care. NMCDH will implement evidence-based practices to address the health concern related to members of the community receiving age and gender-appropriate screenings and other preventive services, including recommended routine immunizations. 3.2: Investigate innovative ways to connect uninsured members of the community with applicable entitlement programs and available healthcare and social services to improve access to medical care. Patients in need of financial assistance were connected with appropriate resources and assisted in the completion of applications for government assistance programs. 3.3: Improve access to evidence-based preventive services, including age and gender-appropriate screenings and routine immunizations. A total of 50 vaccine clinics were provided in Tax Year 2018, as well as 989 individuals in need received breast cancer screening. Non-Priority Areas The CHNA report identified areas of opportunity for health improvement for which NMCDH and the external steering committee (ESC) determined it would not prepare an implementation plan and strategy. These areas of opportunity and the reasons for not addressing are below. Cancer: NMCDH provides a comprehensive range of clinical services to treat and screen for cancer. NMCDH will continue to sustain these services and work to strengthen community-based outreach. The ESC recommended focusing efforts on other health conditions for which NMCDH could have a greater impact (heart failure and nutrition and weight). Immunization and Infectious Disease in Adults: NMCDH provides clinical services to treat pneumonia, asthma and tuberculosis. The ESC recommended that NMCDH focus on strengthening and improving access to medical homes, where preventive care and screening services can be effectively coordinated and access to medically necessary specialty care can be facilitated. Vaccine services are provided to children as part of the access to care strategies. Tobacco Use: Tobacco use was incorporated into the strategies around chronic disease.</ExplanationTxt>

        <ExplanationTxt>Facility , 1 - DELNOR-COMMUNITY HOSPITAL. Through the prioritization process, NMDH identified three Priority Health Needs: Access to Healthcare Services, Chronic Disease, and Mental Health. NMDH identified health needs that would be best addressed through a coordinated response from a range of healthcare and community resources. Specific ways in which NMDH is addressing the significant needs identified in its most recently conducted CHNA are defined as follows: Priority 1: Mental Health Mental health and physical health are closely connected. Mental health plays an integral role in the ability to maintain physical health. Mental illnesses, such as depression, anxiety and addiction, affect people's ability to participate in health promoting behaviors. Subsequently, the presence of mental health problems can have a serious impact on chronic disease and decrease the ability to participate in treatment and recovery. To address the identified health needs related to Mental Health and Substance Abuse, NMDH and members of the External Steering Committee plan to collaborate on the following strategies: 1.1: Continue strategic planning efforts to evaluate the demand for hospital-based mental health services and identify appropriate NMDH resources to address those needs. A comprehensive strategic plan is being developed to properly address the mental health needs of the NMDH and Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage service areas. The plan will identify the needs and develop strategies to address those needs, including but not limited to expansion of inpatient behavioral health and addiction services and additional capacity in the outpatient mental health service line. 1.2: Provide Community Benefit Grant funding and further solidify relationships with community agencies that can provide outpatient mental health services to the medically underserved residents within the service area. Grants were provided to Tri City Family Services, Ecker Center, Samara Care and World Relief. The following outcomes were reported: Tri City Family Services grant outcomes: 1. 98% reported "I feel hopeful that I can achieve my goals in therapy"; 2. 98% reported "the therapy I am receiving is helping me deal more effectively"; 3. 98% reported "I am functioning better at work" and "I am functioning better in my daily life"; Ecker Center grant outcomes: 1. Medication Possession Ratio: baseline is 0.89 and it was measured to be consistently a .92 over the grant period; 2. Clients' symptoms improvement baseline is 72% and it was measured that 90% of clients reports symptom improvement. Individuals impacted by funding from the Samara Care: Mental Health Access Program reported: (NMDH/NMCDH) 1. 87% of clients experienced an increase in their GAF scale score; 2. 90% of those who completed the client satisfaction survey indicated that they agree/strongly agree, "I feel I was able to accomplish what I set out to do," "I am better able to handle conflict and stress." 3. 95% of those who completed the client satisfaction survey indicated that they agree/strongly agree, "My counselor interventions and interactions were helpful." Outcomes reported as the result of NMDH funding to the World Relief Refugee Wellness Program: (NMDH/NMCDH) 1. 8% of participants were able to identify symptoms of mental illness; 2. 75% were to identify at least 3 helpful mainstream community resources and report stronger connectedness to members of their own community; 3. 68% of refugees receiving mental health treatment demonstrated an increased level of functioning, decreased symptoms and completed treatment goals. 1.3: Participate in and support initiatives within Kane County that are focused on Mental Health. The Kane County Health Department is currently developing a Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) in collaboration with the hospitals and community agencies within the county. One of the identified priorities to be addressed is Mental Health and Substance Abuse. NMDH will continue to participate in the CHIP Executive Committee and the Mental Health Subgroup to develop and implement the action plan to address the health priority of Mental Health and Substance Abuse. 1.4: Complete the planning phase and implement the Mental Health First Aid Program in the NMDH service area. The Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) program is designed to teach residents of the community how to take action when a mental illness is suspected or identified. The intent is to reduce the wide reach and economic toll that mental health disorders and crises have on the community. Individuals within NMDH are currently completing training and the certification process and will begin providing educational sessions to teach parents, family members, caregivers, teachers, school staff, peers and community members how to help an adolescent or adult experiencing a mental health or addiction challenge or crisis. These individuals can then intervene and direct the individual to appropriate resources. The overall goal is to increase awareness and early intervention to those in need of behavioral health services. One NMCDH/NMDH staff was trained to offer the nationally recognized evidence-based Mental Health First Aid program. 1. 18 classes were held; 2. 271 individuals attended the programs; 3. 100% of MHFA participants scored a minimum of 85% on the MHFA course exam. Priority 2: Chronic Disease: Chronic conditions are responsible for 70% of deaths and 75% of healthcare spending. Chronic disease is a leading cause of disability and lost income. Chronic disease disproportionally affects low-income and minority populations. In the NMDH service area, 35% of adults have been told that they have high blood pressure; 30% have been told they have a high cholesterol reading; 23% are obese; and chronic diseases of the heart are the second leading cause of death. To address the identified deficiencies in Chronic Disease, NMDH and members of the External Steering Committee plan to collaborate on the following strategies: 2.1: Provide resources and tools to patients diagnosed with heart failure in order to improve self-management skills and quality of life. NMDH continued to provide a post-discharge community-based heart failure program designed to improve the quality of life and decrease readmission rates for patients diagnosed with heart failure. Efforts to improve the coordination of care for heart failure patients were expanded, and a system of referrals for specialty care and social service needs were implemented. A retrospective study of outcomes related to the program was completed to ensure maximum quality is achieved. Key outcomes of this program were: 366 individuals were enrolled in the Community-Based Heart Failure program: (NMCDH/NMDH) 1. 30-day readmission rate for heart failure diagnosis: 1% (markedly below the national rate); 2. 99% of clients demonstrated the ability to identify appropriate action in the event of a worsening of their condition; 3. 96% of clients utilized an effective medication management system; 4. 89% of clients demonstrated compliance with symptom tracking.</ExplanationTxt>

NMDH provided community education related to chronic disease in the areas of evidence-based primary interventions (disease prevention, health promotion), evidence-based secondary interventions (screening) and evidence-based tertiary interventions (education to individuals affected with a chronic disease in an effort to promote an optimum state of individual wellness). Programmatic venues included the CATCH (Coordinated Approach to Child Health) program, the Dinner with the Doc series, clinician-led educational offerings, self-help groups, rehabilitation service programs and support programs. A comprehensive plan to increase patient compliance with physician and ancillary staff referrals to smoking cessation resources was also investigated and developed. Community Benefit Grants were also be provided to agencies that provide programming related to the priority health need of chronic disease. Key outcomes of these interventions include: 1. A total of two educational seminars were offered in the areas of cardiovascular health. A total of 277 individuals attended these seminars. (NMCDH/NMDH combined data.) 2. Meeting space was provided at no charge for 20 support groups. (NMCDH/NMDH) 3. A total of three educational seminars were offered in the areas of cancer. A total of 210 individuals attended these seminars. (NMCDH/NMDH) 4. A total of eleven additional educational seminars were offered. 1,326 individuals attended these seminars. (NMCDH/NMDH) 5. Rehabilitation Services offered 1 community program. 7 individuals attended. (NMCDH/NMDH) 6. Diabetes Education Services offered 18 community programs. 229 individuals attended. (NMCDH/NMDH) 7. Making Kane County Fit for Kids a. Provided parents and children with information on physical activity and eating habits; b. Supported a culture of wellness and health promotion in schools, workplaces, and other institutions; c. Developed land use, planning and policies to support physical activity; d. Provide affordable and accessible fresh fruit and vegetables to all families. 8. 104 individuals participated in the Northern Illinois Food Bank's Diabetes Prevention Education Programs. 9. Saint Charles Park District CATCH Kids Club utilized their new CATCH Early Childhood equipment set and curriculum to impact the health and wellness of the students and families that attended Baker Station. 10. Fox Valley Food for Health built a network of adult and teen volunteers who helped in providing nutrient rich meals, nutrition education and personal caring support to individuals and families dealing with serious illness such as cancer. 11. The CATCH Program reached over 1,500 students and teachers. 91% of children were able to verbalize 6 out of 8 GO foods. 97% of children recognized the importance of consuming GO foods daily. 95% of schools/programs adjusted their snack lists to include healthy (GO) foods. 98% of teachers organized 20 minutes of moderate physical activity. 95% of teachers continued to reinforce the GO-WHOA healthy food message in the classroom. (NMCDH/NMDH) 12. A total of 10 community programs and 679 individuals participated in Community Stroke Education presentations. (NMDH/NMCDH) 1. A total of 91 Kits for Kids were disseminated in the areas hand washing, bicycle safety and healthy nutrition. (NMCDH/NMDH) 2.

A total of 994 car seats were checked / distributed (NMCDH/NMDH) Well Child Center grant outcomes: 1. 73% of the children in the Pediatric Dental Program completed a preventive 6-month appointment; 2. 62% of the children have no decay; 3. 67% of the children followed up for 6-month preventive care; 4. 77% of the children have no new decay; 5. 97% of parents confidence levels increased in preventive dentistry and knowledge of how to practice good dental care., including understanding the ADA recommended guidelines. Priority 3: Access to Care: An aging population, coupled with a challenging economy and an increasing prevalence of chronic disease, create access-to-care issues relating to both the affordability and availability of care. NMDH seeks to promote access through a variety of initiatives identified below. NMDH will continue to work with individuals and families to promote access to medically necessary services by maintaining an accessible financial assistance program. Additionally, staff and leadership will work collaboratively with key community partners to promote a seamless continuum of care into local medical home settings. To improve Access to Health Services, NMDH and members of the External Steering Committee plan to collaborate on the following strategies: 3.1: Strengthen and increase patient affiliation with high-quality patient-centered medical homes. NMDH and its partners from the External Steering Committee focused efforts on strengthening the care coordination, availability, cultural competency and offerings available at the patient-centered medical homes operated by the Federally Qualified Health Centers and healthcare organizations that are closely aligned with Northwestern Medicine Delnor Hospital. By concentrating efforts on improving the most essential community-based component of the healthcare system - the patient-centered medical home - NMDH focused on ensuring patients receive timely and appropriate care. NMDH continued its long-established partnership with Tri City Health Partnership looked for ways to strengthen the patient-centered medical home. NMDH supported this partnership through grant funding, knowledge sharing efforts and streamlined access to medically appropriate diagnostic and specialty services at NMDH and within the Northwestern Medicine Regional Medical Group. In Tax Year 2018, 194 patients from TCHP received care at no charge at Northwestern Medicine facilities. NMDH will implement evidence-based practices to address the health concern related to members of the community receiving age and gender-appropriate screenings and other preventive services, including recommended routine immunizations. 3.2: Investigate innovative ways to connect uninsured members of the community with applicable entitlement programs and available healthcare and social services to improve access to medical care. Patients in need of financial assistance were connected with appropriate resources and assisted in the completion of applications for government assistance programs. 3.3: Improve access to evidence-based preventive services, including age and gender-appropriate screenings and routine immunizations. A total of 50 vaccine clinics were provided in Tax Year 2018, as well as 989 individuals in need received breast cancer screening. Non-Priority Areas The CHNA report identified areas of opportunity for health improvement for which NMDH and the external steering committee (ESC) determined it would not prepare an implementation plan and strategy. These areas of opportunity and the reasons for not addressing are below. Cancer: NMDH provides a comprehensive range of clinical services to treat and screen for cancer. NMDH will continue to sustain these services and work to strengthen community-based outreach. The ESC recommended focusing efforts on other health conditions for which NMDH could have a greater impact (heart failure and nutrition and weight). Immunization and Infectious Disease in Adults: NMDH provides clinical services to treat pneumonia, asthma and tuberculosis. The ESC recommended that NMDH focus on strengthening and improving access to medical homes, where preventive care and screening services can be effectively coordinated and access to medically necessary specialty care can be facilitated. Vaccine services are provided to children as part of the access to care strategies. Tobacco Use: Tobacco use was incorporated into the strategies around chronic disease.</ExplanationTxt>

        <ExplanationTxt>Facility , 1 - NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE VALLEY WEST HOSPITAL. Northwestern Medicine Valley West Hospital (NMVW) completed a comprehensive Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) to identify the highest priority health needs of residents within our community, and use this information to guide new and existing efforts to improve the overall health of the populations served. The goals of the CHNA was to implement a structured data driven approach to determine health status, behaviors, and needs of all residents in the NMVW service area. Through this assessment and prioritization process NMVW identified four health priority needs; adolescent health, behavioral health/mental health, chronic disease (cardiovascular disease and cancer), and maternal child health. Specific ways in which NMVW is addressing the needs identified in the CHNA are defined as follows: Priority 1: Adolescent Health Adolescents (age 10 to 19) make up 16 percent of the DeKalb County population. The behavioral patterns established during these developmental periods can help determine young people's current health status and their risk for developing chronic disease during adulthood. Health and social problems that may start or peak during these years include mental disorders, substance use, smoking/nicotine use, nutrition and weight conditions, sexually transmitted infections, teen pregnancy, homelessness, homicide, suicide and motor vehicle collisions. Effective programs and policies that address these issues can provide protective factors during these important stages in a person's life. 1.1: Advocate for use of evidence based anti-bullying curriculum in schools. To decrease the percentage of adolescents reporting being bullied in the past 12 months, as related to name calling, physical threats, hitting, punching, kicking, pushing or cyber bullying.

        <ExplanationTxt>Facility , 1 - MARIANJOY REHABILITATION HOSPITAL. Through the prioritization process, Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital (MRH) identified four priority health needs: 1. Access to healthcare services 2. Chronic disease management and rehabilitation 3. Promoting Independence in Individuals with Disabilities 4. Injury Prevention MRH identified priority health needs that would be best addressed through a coordinated response from a range of healthcare and community resources. Specific ways in which MRH is addressing the significant needs identified in its most recently conducted CHNA are below. Priority Need 1: Access to healthcare services: MRH ensures that residents of our community have access to high quality medically necessary healthcare services in the most appropriate setting. Dedicated to the delivery of physical medicine and rehabilitation, MRH offers specialty programs for adult and pediatric patients recovering from injury or illness in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. MRH is committed to developing and maintaining programs that address the affordability of and accessibility to healthcare services. Additionally, MRH offers a comprehensive financial assistance program to patients who are unable to afford the cost of necessary medical care. MRH seeks to engage and maintain a multicultural workforce of primary care providers, specialists, midlevel practitioners, registered professional nurses and other specialties committed to working in an evidence-based practice setting by providing a clinical site for educational experiences. The development and implementation of the DuPage County Access to Health Services Action Plan is led by the DuPage Health Coalition. Formerly known as Access DuPage, the Coalition is a collaborative effort by thousands of individuals and hundreds of organizations in DuPage County to provide access to medical services to the county's low-income, medically uninsured residents. The DuPage Health Coalition also operates the Silver Access Program, which provides financial help to lower income families purchasing Health Insurance through the Affordable Care Act's Healthcare Marketplace. In early 2017, the DuPage Health Coalition will open the DuPage Dispensary of Hope, a new free pharmacy program in Wheaton, offered in partnership with DuPage County. MRH leadership and staff work collaboratively with the DuPage Coalition to promote affordable access to care for all residents of DuPage County. MRH will continue to support national and local efforts to increase access to care by providing leadership, investing resources and working collaboratively with other community organizations throughout the county. In conjunction with DuPage Health Coalition's Access DuPage program and independent medical providers, MRH will support the maintenance of an efficient and effective continuum of care for individuals with disabilities, offering inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services to those in need. 1.1: MRH will offer financial assistance policies that are easily accessible, user-friendly, respectful, and meet all regulatory requirements. Marianjoy integrated the promotion and availability of the financial assistance program within registration, billing and all patient financial interactions. 1.2: MRH will continue to provide medically necessary inpatient and outpatient hospital services to uninsured and underinsured patients in accordance with the hospital's financial assistance policies. MRH tracked the number of individuals and the amount of rendered financial assistance annually. In FY19, 641 patients/services provided, in the amount of $3,430,067 of community care provided. 1.3: MRH will continue to address the needs of individuals identified as potentially eligible for public health insurance by facilitating their application for government-sponsored healthcare coverage via a trained in-person staff who will assist in facilitating enrollment. In FY19, MRH maintained 99% approval rate of applications submitted. 1.4: MRH leadership will continue representation on various task forces and work groups related to the collaborative work occurring on access to care issues. In FY19, MRH continued coordination of monetary support of Access DuPage services. 1.5: MRH will provide low-cost transportation to outpatient appointments. In FY19, MRH provided 7,893 rides through MRH transport services. 1.6: MRH will continue to provide free inpatient and outpatient care to all Access DuPage clients in accordance with presumptive eligibility and existing MRH financial assistance policies. Opportunities to promote coordinated care to needed services for Access DuPage will be evaluated. In FY19, 641 patients/services provided, in the amount of $3,430,067 of community care provided. 1.7: MRH will serve as a training center for physicians, nursing and other allied health professions. Quantitative data, such as the number and types of internships and staff time commitment, was tracked throughout FY19 and maintained 99% approval rate of applications submitted. 1.8: MRH will provide trained professional healthcare interpreters and offer language assistance programs. In FY19, MRH provided a total of $457,622 in interpreter services for MRH patients, including $9,663 on phone interpretation and the remainder on in-person interpretation. Priority Need 2: Chronic disease management and rehabilitation: In general, individuals with disabilities tend to experience higher percentages of health disparities than the larger population. These added challenges can result in further impaired mobility, nutritional deficits and an increased susceptibility to chronic medical conditions. Common precursors of chronic diseases, including physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension and high cholesterol, are more prevalent among persons with disabilities than those without. Despite increased health risks, people with disabilities are rarely targeted by specific health-promotion and disease-prevention efforts. Given the increasing prevalence of disability as the population ages, the need for community health services focusing on the rehabilitation needs of those served will likely increase at a proportional rate. A broad range of intervention exists to address the issue of chronic disease including health education, health screenings, supporting linkages to medical homes, and chronic disease management programs. MRH utilizes a collaborative, evidence-based approach to prevention, screening and chronic disease management aimed at reducing and eliminating many of the prominent contributors to mortality in the United States. Programs such as Access DuPage and Engage DuPage ensure access to routine healthcare, screening, primary care providers, specialists, medications and medical homes. MRH offers a comprehensive financial assistance program to individuals unable to afford the cost of their acute medical care. In addition, the hospital offers a comprehensive array of community education programing and services to support both primary and tertiary interventions. 2.1: MRH will offer evidence-based community health and wellness programming in the areas of chronic disease management and rehabilitation, overcoming the limitations of chronic disabilities. In FY19, MRH staff developed curriculum for the four courses listed below. Follow-up based on course content was tracked through the support groups. 1. Pediatric Oncology 2. Relaxation and Meditation 3. Balance and Fall Risks 4. Behavioral Coaching 2.2: MRH will provide access to the Emerging Fitness Center, including specialty group classes for individuals with specific exercise needs. In FY19, 3,500 sessions were held in the MRH Fitness Center for individuals with disabilities. Many of the participants were prior MRH patients or family members. 2.3: MRH will offer evidence-based support programs in the areas of chronic disease management programmatic venues including but not limited to, self-help and support groups. In FY19, MRH provided the following support groups: 1. Amputee (5 sessions; 54 participants) 2. Parkinson's (4 sessions; 28 participants) 3. Caregiver Support (10 sessions; 29 participants) 4. Stroke (6 sessions; 48 participants) 5. ALS (7 sessions; 142 participants) 6. Aphasia (7 sessions; 170 participants) 7. Connections-Peds (7 sessions; 102 participants) 8. High Hopes- BI (7 sessions; 140 participants) 9. Lives in Motion- SCI (7 sessions; 114 participants) 10. MS (5 sessions; 76 participants)</ExplanationTxt>

Priority Need 3: Promoting Independence in Individuals with Disabilities: The physicians and clinicians at MRH are trained in the provision of specialty treatments and rehabilitation for individuals with disabilities resulting from injuries, accidents, illnesses, or congenital defects. Fitness and wellness programs tailored to people with disabilities and other health issues help ensure these vulnerable populations are engaged in moderate physical activity designed to improve strength and increase flexibility, to protect against further disability and enhance functional independence. The addition of the Marianjoy Fitness Center has opened new opportunities for individuals who may not have felt physically able or comfortable in other exercise settings. Throughout the year, MRH offers a variety of free and public classes and lectures (focused on health and wellness) to support and promote the independence of disabled individuals. Additionally, MRH sponsors a variety of support groups at no cost and open to the public including: amputation, aphasia, brain injury, chronic pain, and stroke. MRH works closely with its community partners to promote independence of disabled individuals. Partners include, but are not limited to the DuPage County Health Department, DuPage Federation on Human Service Reform, local school districts, Office of the Secretary of State, and DuPage Workforce Board. 3.1: MRH will provide aquatic programs in a group class setting for adults and children. In FY19, MRH provided 242 patient sessions (3,000 pool sessions provided). Individual goals were established, and PHI documented towards goal attainment. 3.2 MRH will provide services through the Tellabs Center for Neurorehabilitation and Neuroplasticity, an innovative rehab technology designed to support a wide range of patient conditions which benefit from the creation of lasting neuro-pathway changes derived through repetition. In FY19, MRH provided 4,573 sessions using the mobility and upper extremity robotic equipment available in the TCNN. In addition, patients were assessed by therapy experts and individual goals were established. 3.3: The Marianjoy Driver Rehabilitation Program will work with clients utilizing specialized equipment to promote the ability to drive for individuals with disabilities. Participants are provided with a comprehensive appraisal of a person's ability to drive safely. The Driver Rehabilitation Program also provides behind-the-wheel training for students that qualify, and will assist in obtaining the requirements for a driver's license. In FY19, MRH evaluated and/or provided drivers training to 128 students. In addition, a self-reported tracking process was implemented. 3.4: MRH will provide the GoBabyGo program, where therapists and engineers collaborate to retrofit powered toy vehicles to meet the needs of children with disabilities. In FY19, 100 volunteers from the community participated in MRH's GoBabyGo program which served 23 children, 4 of which were new recipients. The program provided four car upgrades from existing participants. 3.5: MRH will offer evidence-based community health and wellness programming in the areas of chronic disease management and rehabilitation, overcoming the limitations of chronic disabilities, including but not limited to the following topic: Life after an amputation. In FY19, MRH staff developed curriculum for the four courses listed below. Follow-up based on course content was tracked through the support groups. 1. Pediatric Oncology 2. Relaxation and Meditation 3. Balance and fall risks 4. Behavioral Coaching 3.6: MRH will offer evidence-based support programs in the areas of promoting independence in programmatic venues including but not limited to, self-help and support groups. In FY19, MRH provided the following support groups: 1. Amputee (5 sessions; 54 participants) 2. Parkinson's (4 sessions; 28 participants) 3. Caregiver Support (10 sessions; 29 participants) 4.

High Hopes- BI (7 sessions; 140 participants) 9. Lives in Motion- SCI (7 sessions; 114 participants) 10. MS (5 sessions; 76 participants) Priority Need 4: Injury Prevention: MRH offers a variety of programs, both through inpatient and outpatient services, to address injury prevention. Evidence-based, community health and wellness programming are offered by MRH in the areas of chronic disease management and rehabilitation and overcoming the limitations of chronic disabilities. Some topics include: Core Yoga to increase strength and balance in individuals with disabilities; Understanding, identifying and preventing running injuries; and how aging affects your balance. These programs address the prevention of injury for both persons with or without disabilities. MRH offers the Police Interaction Course for Drivers with Special Needs program, focusing on enhancing communication between autistic individuals and first responders. MRH works closely with its community partners to address the issue of injury prevention. Partners include, but are not limited to the DuPage County Health Department, Northwestern Memorial Central DuPage Hospital and local school districts. 4.1: MRH will offer evidence-based community health and wellness programming in the areas of chronic disease management and rehabilitation, overcoming the limitations of chronic disabilities. In FY19, MRH developed and implemented curriculum for three courses: 1. Yoga (10 five-week sessions were held; 100 participants) 2. Aging and Balance (2 courses; 68 participants) 3. Therapeutic Golf Program (12 adult sessions; 139 participants) 4.2: MRH will offer the Police Interaction Course for Driver with Special Needs program. Sessions will provide autistic individuals with the skills to respond calmly and communicate effectively during a traffic stop. In FY19, MRH staff will be able to monitor and track program outcomes, as well as the number of programs offered and individuals attending when the program is reimplemented in FY20. 4.3: MRH will collaborate with Central DuPage Hospital (NMCDH) to offer evidence-based community-based injury prevention programming. In FY19, MRH collaborated with NMCDH and began to market programming in the shared NM program brochure. To increase efficiency, course registration was transitioned to the general NM registration line, and data will be collected in FY19 to measure the impact of this program. Needs that are not being addressed together with the reasons why: The CHNA report identified areas of opportunity for health improvement for which Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital and the external steering committee determined it would not prepare an implementation plan and strategy. These areas of opportunity and the reasons for not addressing are below. Mental health and substance abuse: The DuPage behavioral health collaborative was formed in response to the mental health findings and needs noted in the DuPage county IPLAN. The mission of the group is to work collaboratively to identify and implement data-driven strategies that improve access and quality of behavioral health services for all DuPage county residents, advocate for aligning resources and funding, and to educate the community about the signs and symptoms of mental health issues. The collaborative is composed of two teams: the treatment leadership team (behavioral health) and the prevention leadership team (substance abuse). Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital (NMCDH) leadership and staff serve as integral members of both teams working both independently and collaboratively to address mental health and substance abuse issues in DuPage County. Both teams are comprised of members from local hospitals, public health, private and community sectors and represent a broad cross-section of the community united to respond to both issues. Additionally, the DuPage county health department crisis intervention unit is a mental health support system that deals with mental health emergencies on a 24-hour basis. This unit deals with urgent mental health issues that require immediate attention such as suicidal thoughts, homicidal threats, and symptoms of serious mental illness including depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety and other issues that may require hospitalization. Individuals can contact the unit at any time and set up an appointment either by phone or in person. The crisis program also has a ten-bed respite unit available for short term stabilization. Psychiatric evaluations and short-term crisis counseling intervention are also available on a scheduled basis as needed.</ExplanationTxt>

        <ExplanationTxt>Facility , 3 - MARIANJOY REHABILITATION HOSPITAL. In the area of inpatient care, NMCDH offers immediate help, providing short-term psychiatric care for adults and teens (13 years of age and older) in a hospital setting. Short term inpatient care is provided in three secure hospital psychiatric units to help people who pose a risk to themselves or others and those who are unable to care for themselves. Following stabilization, NMCDH offers a full range of treatment including outpatient partial hospitalization, individual and family therapy, group therapy and follow-up services in the community. NMCDH also offers a full range of substance abuse services including inpatient detoxification, residential treatment and rehabilitation services, along with continued counseling to support long-term recovery. Immunization and infectious disease: The DuPage County Health Department is responsible for monitoring the incidence of infectious diseases and providing childhood and adult immunizations. Immunization services are offered at the CPHC (Wheaton), SEPHC (Westmont), and EPHC (Lombard) offices. Childhood immunizations are available for all children who do not have insurance, or have insurance that does not cover immunizations, through the state of Illinois' Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. Additionally, immunizations and selected testing are also offered by the county's Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC), thereby assuring multiple opportunities for residents to receive screening and immunizations. Access to health promotion activities: MRH works collaboratively to support the provision of health promotion and health education sessions to clients residing in the community. It is widely recognized that the most effective way to address chronic disease is to address the problem across its lifespan in a coordinated effort. Health education programs are offered by NMCDH and MRH in an effort to focus on health promotion and disease prevention. Local primary care providers and FQHCs provide medical homes and routine care aimed at screening, early detection and prompt treatment of disease and other health concerns. Local hospitals provide immediate and emergently needed acute care. Programs such as access DuPage and engage DuPage ensure access to routine healthcare, screening, primary care providers, specialists, medications and medical homes. Nutrition, physical activity and weight: The problems related to poor nutrition, inadequate physical activity and overweight/obesity are included within the broader category of chronic disease within our Implementation Plan. These factors are considered key root causes of chronic disease and were included in the causal analysis and response. Guided by the ESC, MRH will continue to support and work collaboratively with existing local organizations who are providing affordable primary healthcare to individuals experiencing the remaining healthcare issues noted above as we believe they are best positioned to lead the provision of these services.</ExplanationTxt>

        <ExplanationTxt>Facility , 1 - NORTHERN ILLINOIS MEDICAL CENTER. Northwestern Medicine commissioned Professional Research Consultants, Inc. (PRC) to conduct a comprehensive Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). PRC is a nationally recognized healthcare consulting firm with extensive experience in conducting CHNAs in hundreds of communities across the United States since 1994. The PRC CHNA framework consisted of a systematic, data-driven approach to determine the health status, behaviors and needs of residents in McHenry County. The assessment provided information to enable NM hospital leadership and key community stakeholders to identify health issues of greatest concern among all residents and decide how best to commit the hospital's resources to those areas, thereby achieving the greatest possible impact on the community's health status. The PRC assessment incorporated data from both quantitative and qualitative sources and was conducted from March 2019 through May 2019. Qualitative data included primary research gathered through an Online Key Informant Survey which was administered, analyzed and summarized by PRC. Key informants are those individuals who have a broad interest in the health of the community, and can advise healthcare organizations by providing a comprehensive biopsychosocial picture of community need. A list of recommended participants was provided by Northwestern Medicine and included the names and contact information for physicians, public health representatives, other health professionals, social service providers, and a variety of other community leaders. Potential participants were chosen because of their ability to identify primary concerns of the McHenry County populations with whom they work, as well as of the community overall. Key informants were contacted by email, introducing the purpose of the survey and providing a link to take the survey online; reminder emails were sent as needed to increase participation. In all, 34 community stakeholders took part in the Online Key Informant Survey. The Key Informant Online Survey was made available April 18, 2019 through May 3, 2019. Final participation included representatives of the organizations outlined below: 1. American Cancer Society 2. Centegra Physician Care 3. City of Woodstock 4. Family Health Partnership Clinic 5. Fox River Grove Fire Protection Dist. 6. Home of the Sparrow 7. Huntley School District 158 8. McHenry County Department of Health 9. McHenry Division of Transportation 10. McHenry County Mental Health Board 11. McHenry County Sheriff's Office 12. McHenry County Substance Abuse Coalition 13. Northern Il. Special Recreation Assoc. 14. Northwestern Medicine 15. Options &amp; Advocacy Program 16. PFLAG McHenry 17. The Positive Way 18. Thresholds 19. United Way of McHenry County 20. Village of Richmond Through this process, input was gathered from several individuals whose organizations work with low-income, minority, or other medically underserved populations. In the online survey, key informants were asked to rate the degree to which various health issues are a problem in their own community. Follow-up questions asked them to describe why they identify problem areas as such and how these might better be addressed.</ExplanationTxt>

Through a systematic, data-driven approach, NM NWR has prioritized the below identified Significant Health Needs to address in accordance with IRS regulations. These needs will be referred to as the Priority Health Needs throughout the remainder of the document. NM NWR worked collaboratively to develop strategies, and to identify resources and areas for collaboration, where applicable, to impact each priority health need. 1. Access to Health Care 2. Chronic Disease (including a. cancer, b. diabetes, c. heart disease and stroke, and d. nutrition, physical activity and weight) 3. Mental Health and Substance Abuse Priority 1: Access to Healthcare Services. Access to comprehensive, quality healthcare services is important for the achievement of health equity and for increasing the quality of a healthy life for everyone. It impacts overall physical, social and mental health status; prevention of disease and disability; detection and treatment of health conditions; quality of life; preventable death; and life expectancy. Improving healthcare services includes increasing access to and use of evidence-based preventive services. Clinical preventive services are services that prevent illness by detecting early warning signs or symptoms before they develop into a disease (primary prevention) or detect a disease at an earlier, and often more treatable, stage (secondary prevention). 1.1: Improve access to comprehensive, quality healthcare services. NM HH, NM MH and NM WH will continue to address the needs of individuals identified as potentially eligible for public health insurance by facilitating their application for government-sponsored healthcare coverage. 1. NM HH, NM MH and NM WH financial services assists patients in applying for government-sponsored healthcare coverage. 2. NM HH, NM MH and NM WH leadership will continue representation on various task forces and workgroups related to the collaborative work occurring on access-to-care issues. 3. NM HH, NM MH and NM WH will create and/or participate in programs and initiatives focused on Safety Net objectives to promote access to care. 4. NM HH, NM MH and NM WH will provide office space and support to the Senior Health Insurance Program (SHIP). The SHIP program will provide seniors Medicare counseling and support to facilitate their use of the healthcare system. During the time frame of September 1, 2018 to August 31, 2019, there were 850 Medicare beneficiaries that received information on insurance options and assistance with enrollment in various programs, with 80 individuals receiving assistance with enrollment into various programs. NM provide space for two individuals to meet with members of the community learn about and enroll in options. 1.2: NM Leadership participates in meetings that are focused on addressing access to care issues for patients that need assistance. Most patients are referred from Aunt Martha's FQHC and/or The Family Health Partnership Clinic. 1. NM HH, NM MH and NM WH will provide operational grants to Aunt Martha's and Family Health Partnership Clinic in support of their coordination of care for patients without insurance. Provision of an operational grant to Aunt Martha's and Family Health Partnership Clinic will enable low-income McHenry County residents to afford and receive needed care. 2. NM HH, NM MH and NM WH will provide low-cost or no-cost inpatient and outpatient care to clients from Aunt Martha's and/or Family Health Partnership Clinic in accordance with presumptive eligibility and existing NM financial assistance policies. Access to free inpatient and outpatient care will enable presumptively eligible, low-income residents to receive needed services in a timely, coordinated and efficient manner. Aunt Martha's received in kind space with a fair market value of $290,438 and the Family Health Partnership Clinic received an in-kind cash donation to support programs services in the amount of $30,000. Priority 2a: Chronic Disease (Cancer) Continued advances in cancer research, detection and treatment have resulted in a decline in both incidence and death rates for all cancers. Among people who develop cancer, more than half will be alive in five years. Yet, cancer remains a leading cause of death in the United States, second only to heart disease. In McHenry County, cancer is a leading and rising cause of death. Many cancers are preventable by reducing risk factors such as use of tobacco products, physical inactivity and poor nutrition, obesity, and ultraviolet light exposure. Other cancers can be prevented by getting vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis B virus. In the past decade, overweight and obesity have emerged as new risk factors for developing certain cancers, including colorectal, breast, uterine corpus (endometrial) and kidney cancers. The impact of the current weight trends on cancer incidence will not be fully known for several decades. Continued focus on preventing weight gain will lead to lower rates of cancer and many chronic diseases. Priority 2b: Chronic Disease (Diabetes) The rate of diabetes mellitus continues to increase both in the United States and throughout the world. Due to the steady rise in the number of persons with diabetes mellitus, and possibly earlier onset of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, there is growing concern about the possibility that the increase in the number of persons with diabetes mellitus and the complexity of their care might overwhelm existing healthcare systems. Diabetes is a top 10 leading cause of death, and prevalence of the condition has risen over the past decade in McHenry County. Priority 2c: Chronic Disease (Cardiovascular Disease) Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, with stroke following as the third leading cause. Together, heart disease and stroke are among the most widespread and costly health problems facing the nation today, accounting for more than $500 billion in healthcare expenditures and related expenses in 2010 alone. Fortunately, they are also among the most preventable. The risk of Americans developing and dying from cardiovascular disease would be substantially reduced if major improvements were made across the U.S. population in diet and physical activity, control of high blood pressure and cholesterol, smoking cessation and appropriate aspirin use. The burden of cardiovascular disease is disproportionately distributed across the population. Significant disparities exist based on gender, age, race/ethnicity, geographic area and socioeconomic status. Priority 2d: Chronic Disease (Nutrition, Physical Activity and Weight) Strong science exists supporting the health benefits of eating a healthful diet and maintaining a healthy body weight. Efforts to change diet and weight should address individual behaviors, as well as the policies and environments that support these behaviors in settings such as schools, worksites, healthcare organizations, and communities. The goal of promoting healthful diets and healthy weight encompasses increasing household food security and eliminating hunger. Regular physical activity can improve the health and quality of life of Americans of all ages, regardless of the presence of a chronic disease or disability. Among adults, physical activity can lower the risk of: early death; coronary heart disease; stroke; high blood pressure; type 2 diabetes; breast and colon cancer; falls; and depression. Personal, social, economic, and environmental factors all play a role in physical activity levels among youth, adults, and older adults. Understanding the barriers to and facilitators of physical activity is important to ensure the effectiveness of interventions and other actions to improve levels of physical activity. 2.1: NM HH, NM MH and NM WH will strive to improve cardiovascular health and quality of life through prevention, detection and treatment of risk factors for heart attack and stroke. 2.2: NM HH, NM MH and NM WH will offer early identification and treatment of heart attacks and stroke, through heart age screenings and blood pressure screenings. In partnership with staff from McHenry County Department of Health, NM cardiovascular staff and RNs participated and provided 400 cardiovascular screenings during the reporting time. Monthly events were held for blood pressure events, which provided free screenings to 218 individuals in the community. 2.3: NM HH, NM MH and NM WH will offer education and prevention of repeat cardiovascular events, through education on lifestyle/measures to prevent heart disease. 2.4: NM HH, NM MH and NM WH Reduction in deaths from cardiovascular disease education in the community. A series of programs were offered on nutrition and cardiovascular health reaching 349 residents provided by nurses and dietitians for a total of 79 hours. Staff provided 85 hours to provide education to 111 people on CPR education and training.</ExplanationTxt>

There were five community events that were offered, with over 75 staff hours provided reaching 81 individuals. 2.6: NM HH, NM MH and NM WH will host/offer evidence-based community health and wellness programming in skin cancer education and prevention. Cancer Center staff conducted educational activities on skin cancer prevention at outdoor recreational areas and provide free sunscreen SPF 15 or higher to adults and children. These four community events with which over 40 hours of staff time was devoted to skin cancer prevention and education, resulting in 78 people being served. 2.7: NM HH, NM MH and NM WH will support opportunities to promote physical activity in McHenry County residents including increased access to physical activity options in school-aged children and encouragement of physical activity to prevent childhood and adult obesity.) There were several events held locally that encouraged participation in activities to promote physical activity, such as walks, runs, gym memberships, etc. NM staff provided 48 hours of in-kind support to Girls on the Run, which impact 13 girls and encouraged running to maintain an active lifestyle. In addition, there were over 1,245 individuals that received charitable memberships to Health Bridge Fitness, which is owned by Northwestern Medicine. Priority 3: Mental Health/Substance Abuse Mental health is a state of successful performance of mental function, resulting in productive activities, fulfilling relationships with other people, and the ability to adapt to change and to cope with challenges. Mental health is essential to personal well-being, family and interpersonal relationships, and the ability to contribute to community or society. Mental health and physical health are closely connected. Mental health plays a major role in people's ability to maintain good physical health. Mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety, affect people's ability to participate in health-promoting behaviors. In turn, problems with physical health, such as chronic diseases, can have a serious impact on mental health and decrease a person's ability to participate in treatment and recovery. In McHenry County in 2019, there were 176.3 mental health providers for every 100,000 population, below state and U.S rates. Substance abuse has a major impact on individuals, families and communities. The effects of substance abuse are cumulative, significantly contributing to costly social, physical, mental and public health problems. Advances in research have led to the development of evidence-based strategies to effectively address substance abuse. Improvements in brain-imaging technologies and the development of medications that assist in treatment have gradually shifted the research community's perspective on substance abuse. There is now a deeper understanding of substance abuse as a disorder that develops in adolescence and, for some individuals, will develop into a chronic illness that will require lifelong monitoring and care. Half of key informants taking part in the online survey characterized Substance Abuse as a "major problem" in the community. 3.1: Increase awareness of existing mental health and substance abuse services in McHenry County. There were four presentations with 26 people receiving education on the effects of opiate addiction in expecting mothers. The program provided sensitivity to treatment to OB nurses that may encounter pregnant women who may be affected by a substance abuse disorder. 3.2: Reduce the overall number of suicide deaths in McHenry County. (Provide PHQ-9 depression screening tool to patients with the primary care setting and increase in the number of support groups and attendees related to suicide and/or survivors of suicide.) Physicians in primary care settings utilized PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 for depression screening for their patients, with a 74.52% performance test rate, which was an increase from the previous year of 39.18% screening rates. 3.3: Increase in the number of support groups and attendees related to suicide and/or survivors of suicide. (Provide community education on Suicide Prevention to the community at-large to reduce the number of opioid-/heroin-related overdose deaths and adverse events.) The Behavioral Health Services team coordinated the Survivors of Suicide Grief Support Group which increased from a monthly session to twice monthly sessions. In addition, the same Behavioral Services Team provided leadership to the Suicide Prevention Task Force, which was an in-kind staff support of 50 hours. Significant Health Needs Not Addressed by NM NWR Through a systematic, data-driven approach, NM NWR has determined that it will not address the below identified Significant Health Needs over the next three years. Many of these needs are already being addressed through the comprehensive services and Community Benefits operations offered at the three NM NWR hospitals and throughout NMHC. Specific reasons explaining why an identified Significant Health Need will not be prioritized are outlined below. Oral Health: While the need for improved dental health and access to dental health providers exists, NM leadership does not feel that we possess the expertise to address this health concern. Rather, we will work collaboratively with existing community initiatives to promote programming that will expand access to dental care and improve dental health of community residents. Respiratory Disease: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are significant public health burdens. Specific methods of detection, intervention and treatment exist that may reduce this burden and promote health. The prevalence of respiratory disease in McHenry County residents is lower than in Illinois and the U.S., so we have chosen not to focus on this Significant Health Need.</ExplanationTxt>

NMHC shall, in accordance with Illinois Hospital Uninsured Patient Discount Act, provide Free Care and Discounted Care to Uninsured Patients. NMHC provides Free Care and Discounted Care to eligible Applicants who are uninsured or underinsured. Those who do not qualify for free care will receive a sliding scale discount off the gross charges for their medically necessary services based on their family income as a percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines. These patients are expected to pay their remaining balance for care, and may work with financial counselors to set up a payment plan based on their financial situation. Patients seeking assistance may first be asked to apply for other external programs (such as Medicaid or insurance through the public marketplace) as appropriate before eligibility under this policy is determined. Additionally, any uninsured patients who are believed to have the financial ability to purchase health insurance may be encouraged to do so to help ensure healthcare accessibility and overall well-being. NMHC will not bill patients who have been deemed eligible for financial assistance coverage for eligible care or services, including care or services that are emergent or medically necessary, more than the amounts generally billed to insured patients. Patients who are uninsured or underinsured and have a household income at or below the thresholds per Federal Poverty Guidelines will receive full or partial discount off their balance. The policy is updated on an annual basis to represent the most current federal poverty guideline levels and the appropriate sliding scale for full and partial discounts. To be considered eligible for financial assistance, patients may be required to cooperate with NMHC to explore alternative means of assistance if necessary, including Medicare and Medicaid. Patients will be required to provide necessary information and documentation when applying for hospital financial assistance or other private or public payment programs. NMHC may seek to determine eligibility for financial assistance prior to rendering non-emergent services. In certain non-emergent circumstances it may be necessary to provide care or evaluation to the patient before eligibility can be determined. When determining patients' eligibility, NMHC does not take into account race, gender, age, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, national origin or social or immigrant status. An uninsured Patient demonstrating eligibility under one or more of the following programs shall be deemed eligible for NMHC's Free and Discounted Care program and will not be required to provide additional supporting documentation for financial assistance: A. Presumptive Homelessness; B. Presumptive Mental incapacitation with no one to act on the patient's behalf; C. Presumptive Scoring when NMHC can utilize publically available information as well as internal payment and documentation history to determine if a patient is eligible for presumptive financial assistance without completion of an application. D. Presumptive Deceased with no estate; E. Presumptive State Program: Enrollment in the following assistance programs for low-income individuals having eligibility criteria at or below 200% of the federal poverty income guidelines: 1. Women, Infants and Children Nutrition Program (WIC); 2. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP); 3. Illinois Free Lunch and Breakfast Program; 4. Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP); 5. Enrollment in an organized community-based program providing access to medical care that assess and documents limited low income financial; or 6. Receipt of grant assistance for medical services. F. Presumptive Out of State Program for patients who are eligible for out of state programs based on FPG where NMHC does not participate; G. Additional Presumptive Criteria may also be recommended, including the following: 1. Recent Personal Bankruptcy; 2. Incarceration; 3. Affiliation with a religious order which includes a vow of poverty; 4. Enrollment in temporary assistance for needy families (TANF); or 5. Enrollment in IHDA's Rental Housing Support Program. NMHC also partners with third-parties and other eligibility vendors, to help identify patients who may be eligible for financial assistance, presumptive financial assistance under this policy or through other public and private programs including identifying other sources of third party payment, i.e. health insurance coverage. NMHC may also use previous financial assistance eligibility determinations as a basis for determining eligibility in the event that the patient does not provide sufficient documentation to support an eligibility determination. Financial assistance applications on file at NMHC may be used for a time period of up to six months after the date of submission. All patients presumptively determined to be eligible for less than the most generous amount of assistance available under this policy (free care) will be informed about how the discount amount was calculated and given a reasonable amount of time to submit an application for further financial assistance.</ExplanationTxt>

        <ExplanationTxt>Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital, Central DuPage Hospital, Delnor-Community Hospital, Kishwaukee Community Hospital, Valley West Hospital, and Northern Illinois Medical Center 09/01/2018 - 08/31/2019 NMH, NLFH, CDH, Delnor, Kishwaukee, Valley West, and NIMC shall, in accordance with Illinois Hospital Uninsured Patient Discount Act, provide Free Care and Discounted Care to Uninsured Patients. NMHC provides Free Care and Discounted Care to eligible Applicants who are uninsured through two methods: "uninsured sliding fee scale assistance" and "uninsured catastrophic assistance." If an Applicant qualifies under both methods, NMHC will apply the method that is most beneficial to the Applicant. Despite qualification under either method, if there is reason to believe that an Applicant may have assets in excess of 600% of the then current Federal Poverty Guideline applicable to the Applicant's Family Size and that are available to pay for medical services, NMHC may require the Applicant to provide information about such assets, and the Free Care Committee may consider those assets in deciding whether, and to what extent, to extend Free Care or Discounted Care. Free Care and Discounted Care shall be available for those Uninsured Patients who are Illinois Residents. The NIMC policy in place does not reflect a residency requirement. Non-Residents who are Uninsured Patients are not eligible for Free Care or Discounted Care. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no residency requirement for Uninsured Applicants receiving Emergency Services. Financial Assistance will only be applied to self-pay balances, after all third-party benefits/resources are reasonably exhausted, including, but not limited to, benefits from insurance carriers (e.g., health, home, auto liability, worker's compensation, or employer funded health reimbursement accounts), government programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid or other federal, state, or local programs), or proceeds from litigation, settlements, and/or private fundraising efforts (collectively, "Third-Party Funding Sources"). Patients receiving Financial Assistance and who require Medically Necessary care (other than Emergency Services) must, whenever possible, be screened for eligibility for Medicaid, Health Insurance Exchange, or other available payment programs and, if found eligible, the Patient must fully cooperate with enrollment requirements prior to the procedure being scheduled and/or services being rendered. Eligible Patients who fail or refuse to enroll in available Medicaid, Health Insurance Exchange, or other available payment programs may be ineligible for Financial Assistance. NMHC (or its agent), at its discretion, may assess a Patient's or Guarantor's Financial Assistance eligibility by means other than a completed Application. In such instances, eligibility determinations may include the use of information provided by credit reporting agencies, public records, or other objective and reasonably accurate means of assessing a Patient's or Guarantor's Program eligibility. An uninsured Patient demonstrating eligibility under one or more of the following programs shall be deemed eligible for NMHC's Free and Discounted Care program and will not be required to provide additional supporting documentation for financial assistance. A. Homelessness B. Deceased with no estate C. Mental incapacitation with no one to act on the patient's behalf D. Medicaid eligibility, but not on date of service for non-covered service E. Enrollment in the following assistance programs for low-income individuals having eligibility criteria at or below 200% of the federal poverty income guidelines; 1. Women, Infants and Children Nutrition Program (WIC) 2. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) 3. Illinois Free Lunch and Breakfast Program 4. Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) 5. Enrollment in an organized community-based program providing access to medical care that assess and documents limited low income financial 6. Receipt of grant assistance for medical services Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital &amp; Clinics: 09/01/2018 - 08/31/2019 In addition to FPG guidelines, Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital &amp; Clinics utilizes other factors to determine eligibility for free or discounted care per the organization's charity care policy. These factors include: 1. Family income relative to family size and other related factors such as current financial obligations 2. Employment status, including, but not limited to, future earning capacity sufficient to meet the patient's financial obligations in an acceptable period of time 3. Future and current ability to pay 4. Medical expenses, including pharmaceutical expenses, as a percentage of a patient's annual gross income, the amount of total medical bills outstanding, and the frequency of payments to be made in relation to the factors above 5. Credit report information 6. Actual cost of care provided 7. Other factors deemed appropriate by the health system.</ExplanationTxt>

        <FormAndLineReferenceDesc>Schedule H, Part I, Line 7 Costing Methodology used to calculate financial assistance</FormAndLineReferenceDesc>
        <ExplanationTxt>THE COST OF CHARITY CARE FOR THE HOSPITALS WAS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE TOTAL COST-TO-CHARGE RATIO FROM EACH HOSPITAL'S MEDICARE COST REPORT (CMS 2552-96 WORKSHEET C, PART 1, CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE OF ILLINOIS ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE DEFINITION) TO THE CHARGES ON ACCOUNTS IDENTIFIED AS QUALIFYING FOR CHARITY CARE (AS DEFINED IN THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING GUIDE - HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS). THE RESULTANT CALCULATED COST WAS THEN OFFSET BY ANY PAYMENTS RECEIVED THAT WERE DESIGNATED FOR THE PAYMENT OF PATIENT BILLS QUALIFYING FOR A CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT (AS DEFINED IN THE HEALTHCARE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION'S PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES BOARD STATEMENT 15, VALUATION AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION OF CHARITY CARE AND BAD DEBTS BY INSTITUTIONAL HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS). THE PHYSICIAN GROUPS, INCLUDING NMG, RMG, MMG, AND CPC/CMS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO FILE A MEDICARE COST REPORT. AN INTERNALLY CALCULATED COST-TO-CHARGE RATIO SPECIFIC TO THE PHYSICIAN GROUPS WAS USED TO DETERMINE THE COST OF CHARITY CARE FOR NMG. THE RESULTANT CALCULATED COST WAS THEN OFFSET BY ANY PAYMENTS, CONSISTENT WITH THE METHODOLOGY FOR THE HOSPITALS. THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF BAD DEBT, MEDICAID, MEDICARE OR ANY OTHER FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL INDIGENT HEALTHCARE PROGRAM IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE UNREIMBURSED COST FIGURE FOR CHARITY CARE. THE COSTS OF CHARITY CARE IN THIS REPORT DIFFER FROM NMHC'S NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 WHERE THEY WERE CALCULATED BY APPLYING A COST-TO-CHARGE RATIO DEVELOPED PRIOR TO FILING NMH'S, NLFH'S, CDH'S, DELNOR'S, KISH'S, MARIANJOY'S, AND NIMC'S FISCAL YEAR 2019 MEDICARE COST REPORTS TO CHARGES FOREGONE FOR CHARITY CARE. THE FISCAL YEAR 2019 MEDICARE COST REPORTS WERE COMPLETED AFTER THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE ISSUED. THE COSTS OF CHARITY CARE FOR THE HOSPITALS INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT WERE CALCULATED USING THE COST-TO-CHARGE RATIOS FROM NMH'S, NLFH'S, CDH'S, DELNOR'S, KISH'S, MARIANJOY'S, AND NIMC'S COST REPORTS FILED IN FEBRUARY OF 2020 FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019. COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT SERVICES - THE COST OF LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS INCLUDES BOTH THE COST OF EMPLOYEES AND NONEMPLOYEES TO PROVIDE TRANSLATION SERVICES TO NMHC HOSPITAL PATIENTS AND FAMILY MEMBERS. EDUCATION - UNREIMBURSED EDUCATION COSTS INCLUDE THE COST OF NMHC'S MEDICAL RESIDENCY, FELLOWSHIP AND INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS LESS ANY THIRD-PARTY PAYOR REIMBURSEMENTS AND FEES RECEIVED. SUBSIDIZED HEALTH SERVICES - SUBSIDIZED HEALTH SERVICES INCLUDE THE UNCOMPENSATED COST OF PROVIDING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES, HEALTH EDUCATION AND INFORMATION AND PROGRAMS TO POSITIVELY IMPACT THE WELLNESS OF THE COMMUNITY. COSTS CALCULATED WERE OFFSET BY ANY REIMBURSEMENT RECEIVED FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. THE UNREIMBURSED COST FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WAS ALSO ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF CHARITY CARE AND GOVERNMENT SPONSORED INDIGENT HEALTHCARE. RESEARCH - NMHC PROVIDES SUPPORT TO ADVANCE MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND ACADEMIC PURSUITS. THE REPORTED SUPPORT INCLUDES THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF FUNDS PROVIDED FOR RESEARCH PROJECTS AND UNREIMBURSED OPERATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS TO SUPPORT CLINICAL RESEARCH THAT OCCURS AT NMH, NMG, CDH AND MJRH. DONATIONS - DONATIONS INCLUDE THE DOLLAR AMOUNT RECORDED DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019 IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AS CONTRIBUTIONS TO CHARITABLE AND OTHER COMMUNITY OR CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS FOR FURTHERANCE OF THEIR CHARITABLE PURPOSES.</ExplanationTxt>

        <ExplanationTxt>NMHC HOSPITALS PROVIDE A BROAD RANGE OF TRAINING PROGRAMS AND SUPERVISED PATIENT CARE EXPERIENCES TO ENSURE THAT A HIGHLY TRAINED HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE OF ADEQUATE CAPACITY IS IN PLACE TO SERVE THE RESIDENTS OF THE REGION. IMPORTANTLY, THESE PROGRAMS CREATE PATHWAYS FOR AT-RISK MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY TO SEEK JOBS WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND ALSO ARE IN PLACE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO LEARN ABOUT AND POTENTIALLY EXPLORE HEALTHCARE CAREERS. ALLIED HEALTH SCHOOLS AT NMH NMH OPERATES FOUR ACCREDITED ALLIED HEALTH SCHOOLS - DIAGNOSTIC MEDICAL SONOGRAPHY, NUCLEAR MEDICINE TECHNOLOGY, RADIATION THERAPY AND RADIOLOGY - AS WELL AS A HISTOTECHNOLOGY PROGRAM, POST-PRIMARY CT AND MRI PROGRAMS, AND A MEDICAL ASSISTANT PROGRAM. THE 21-MONTH CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS ARE OPEN TO EMPLOYEES AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. MANY STUDENTS COME FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY, AS WELL AS FROM AFFILIATED COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. LEADERS OF THESE PROGRAMS VISIT CITY HIGH SCHOOLS, COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO INTRODUCE VARIOUS MEDICAL FIELDS TO PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS AND INCREASE THEIR GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF VARIOUS ALLIED HEALTH FIELDS. THE CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS AIM TO ADDRESS THE NEED FOR ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN THE FIELD. IN ADDITION TO TRAINING THE NATION'S FUTURE PHYSICIANS, FEINBERG HAS FURTHER RESPONDED TO THE ANTICIPATED SHORTAGE OF MEDICAL PROVIDERS BY OFFERING A MASTER'S-LEVEL PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT PROGRAM. PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE MEMBERS OF PRIMARY CARE TEAMS THAT INCLUDE MANY LEVELS OF PROVIDERS AND CAN EFFICIENTLY DELIVER THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF CARE TO EXTENDED GROUPS OF PATIENTS. THROUGH FEINBERG'S PROGRAM, PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS ARE EDUCATED AND TRAINED WITHIN THE MEDICAL SCHOOL SETTING AND GAIN CLINICAL EXPERIENCE AT NMHC HOSPITALS.

ONGOING, COMPREHENSIVE, ON-THE-JOB TRAINING AND YOUTH PROGRAMS FOR HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE AND POST-GRADUATE STUDENTS ARE OFFERED AT EVERY HOSPITAL IN THE HEALTH SYSTEM IN BOTH CLINICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE SETTINGS. NM HAS LONG INVESTED IN PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, INCLUDING PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUTH. IN 2011, NMH EMBARKED ON AN EDUCATIONAL PARTNERSHIP WITH WESTINGHOUSE COLLEGE PREPARATORY HIGH SCHOOL (WESTINGHOUSE), A SELECTIVE-ENROLLMENT HIGH SCHOOL ON CHICAGO'S WEST SIDE, TO PROVIDE TALENTED HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT AND PURSUE POST-HIGH-SCHOOL EDUCATION IN HEALTHCARE CAREERS. STUDENTS MEET FEINBERG FACULTY AND HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES, AND ARE PROVIDED A BEHIND-THE-SCENES UNDERSTANDING OF CLINICAL AREAS AND POTENTIAL CAREERS. THE PROGRAM ALSO INCLUDES MENTORING, AN INTENSIVE SUMMER PROGRAM, DISTANCE LEARNING, ACT TEST PREPARATION, AND LEADERSHIP AND LIFE SKILLS DEVELOPMENT. THE PROGRAM HAD 19 PARTICIPANTS IN FY19. REFLECTING THE GEOGRAPHICAL EXPANSION OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM, THE NM DISCOVERY PROGRAM, FORMERLY KNOWN AS MEDICAL EXPLORERS, GREW TO THREE CHAPTERS IN FY19: NM DISCOVERY PROGRAM CENTRAL, NM DISCOVERY PROGRAM WEST AND NM DISCOVERY PROGRAM NORTH. THROUGHOUT THE TWO-YEAR PROGRAM, STUDENTS ARE EXPOSED TO A BROAD RANGE OF ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE THEIR INTEREST IN HEALTHCARE CAREERS. IN ADDITION, THE PROGRAM FOSTERS CHARACTER AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, CULTIVATES LIFE SKILLS, PROVIDES COMMUNITY SERVICE AND LEADERSHIP EXPERIENCE, AND OFFERS MENTORSHIP AND NETWORKING OPPORTUNITIES. ONCE-MONTHLY ACTIVITIES INCLUDE TOURS, GUEST SPEAKERS, GROUP DISCUSSION AND HANDS-ON PROJECTS. IN FY19, 54 STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN THE CENTRAL CHAPTER AND 60 PARTICIPATED IN THE WEST CHAPTER. THE INAUGURAL CLASS OF THE NORTH CHAPTER WELCOMED 24 STUDENTS. ADDITIONALLY, EACH SUMMER, A SELECT NUMBER OF THESE STUDENTS ARE OFFERED INTERNSHIPS IN VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT NMH; NMH HOSTED EIGHT SUMMER INTERNS IN FY19 FROM THE NM DISCOVERY PROGRAM. SINCE THE PROGRAM BEGAN, MANY PARTICIPANTS HAVE PURSUED CAREERS IN NURSING AND OTHER HEALTHCARE FIELDS, AND SEVERAL ARE NOW EMPLOYED AT NMH. IN FY19, THE HEALTH SYSTEM BEGAN PLANNING FOR THE NEXT CHAPTER OF THE NM DISCOVERY PROGRAM - NM DISCOVERY PROGRAM GREATER DEKALB CHAPTER - WHICH LAUNCHED IN THE FALL OF 2019. ADDITIONAL EXPANSION OF BOTH THE NM DISCOVERY PROGRAM AND THE NM DISCOVERY PROGRAM INTERNSHIP ARE EXPECTED IN COMING YEARS.

        <ExplanationTxt>NMHC'S MISSION SETS FORTH OUR COMMITMENT TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE AND TO ADVANCE MEDICAL RESEARCH AND EDUCATION, ONE PATIENT AT A TIME. THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN DESCRIBES THE BROAD-REACHING GOALS THAT SUPPORT THIS COMMITMENT AND ADDRESS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A TAX-EXEMPT ORGANIZATION. THE DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS DEVELOPS AND MAINTAINS A COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN FOR THE HEALTH SYSTEM, WHICH IS EXECUTED AT THE HOSPITAL LEVEL TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. REVIEWED ANNUALLY AND REVISED AS NEEDED, THE OBJECTIVES OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN ARE TO: 1. PROVIDE QUALITY MEDICAL CARE, REGARDLESS OF THE PATIENT'S ABILITY TO PAY. 2. HONOR NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE'S MISSION AND COMMITMENT TO THE COMMUNITY. 3. BE RESPONSIVE TO THE ASSESSED NEEDS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY SERVED BY EACH HOSPITAL. 4. FORGE RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. 5. EVALUATE THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT OF NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE PROGRAMMING, AND REPLICATE BY GEOGRAPHY AND/OR DISEASE STATE WITH SENSITIVITY TO THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF OUR PATIENTS, THEIR FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. 6. LEVERAGE OUR STRENGTHS AS A PREMIER ACADEMIC HEALTH SYSTEM TO TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF CAREGIVERS AND UTILIZE EVIDENCE-BASED MODELS FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH ENGAGEMENT. 7. LEVERAGE OUR BOND WITH NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO BE LEADERS IN QUALITY, ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE, SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY, PATIENT SAFETY AND RESEARCH-INFORMED TREATMENT. ALIGNED WITH OUR MISSIONS AND COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (ACA), EACH OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM HOSPITALS WORKS WITH COMMUNITY AND CAMPUS PARTNERS EVERY THREE YEARS TO COMPLETE A COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA) THAT IDENTIFIES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS OF RESIDENTS OF ITS COMMUNITY. WITH FEINBERG, NMHC BRINGS TO BEAR THE RESOURCES OF A WORLD-CLASS, INTEGRATED ACADEMIC HEALTH SYSTEM TO ADVANCE OUR COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN AND CHNA INITIATIVES IN WAYS THAT COULD NOT BE ACHIEVED AS STAND-ALONE HOSPITALS. PROVIDING BETTER CARE CLOSER TO HOME ALLOWS OUR COMMUNITIES ACCESS TO THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN EDUCATION AND RESEARCH THAT PREVIOUSLY MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. THIS INCLUDES: - SEEKING ROOT CAUSES TO HEALTH CONDITIONS, AND COLLABORATING WITH SCIENTISTS AND CLINICIANS TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS - ENHANCING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE - IMPROVING CLINICAL QUALITY - ADVANCING MEDICAL INNOVATION - ENSURING THAT A HIGHLY SKILLED HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE IS IN PLACE FOR DECADES TO COME - ADDRESSING THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH CHNAS PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT ENABLES HOSPITALS TO IDENTIFY HEALTH ISSUES OF GREATEST CONCERN AMONG RESIDENTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND DECIDE HOW BEST TO COMMIT RESOURCES TO THOSE AREAS, THEREBY MAKING THE GREATEST POSSIBLE IMPACT ON COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS. NMHC EMPLOYS A SYSTEMATIC, DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE HEALTH STATUS, BEHAVIORS AND NEEDS OF THE RESIDENTS OF EACH HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY. EACH CHNA SERVES AS A TOOL TOWARD REACHING THREE GOALS: 1. IMPROVE RESIDENTS' HEALTH STATUS, INCREASE THEIR LIFE SPANS AND ELEVATE THEIR OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE. A HEALTHY COMMUNITY IS ONE WHERE ITS RESIDENTS SUFFER LITTLE FROM PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ILLNESS AND ALSO ENJOY A HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE. 2. REDUCE THE HEALTH DISPARITIES AMONG RESIDENTS. BY GATHERING DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ALONG WITH HEALTH STATUS AND BEHAVIOR DATA, IT IS POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY POPULATION SEGMENTS THAT ARE MOST AT RISK FOR VARIOUS DISEASES AND INJURIES. INTERVENTION PLANS AIMED AT TARGETING THESE SEGMENTS MAY THEN BE DEVELOPED TO COMBAT SOME OF THE SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON RESIDENTS' HEALTH. 3. INCREASE ACCESSIBILITY TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR ALL COMMUNITY RESIDENTS. MORE ACCESSIBLE PREVENTIVE SERVICES ARE BENEFICIAL IN ACCOMPLISHING THE FIRST GOAL (IMPROVING HEALTH STATUS, INCREASING LIFE SPANS AND ELEVATING THE QUALITY OF LIFE), AS WELL AS LOWERING THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CARING FOR LATE-STAGE DISEASES RESULTING FROM A LACK OF PREVENTIVE CARE. THE CHNAS AND CORRESPONDING IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES WERE DEVELOPED WITH FEEDBACK FROM COMMUNITY HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES AND PUBLIC ORGANIZATIONS THAT UNDERSTAND AND HELP REPRESENT THE WIDE-RANGING HEALTHCARE NEEDS OF THE RESIDENTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THE CHNA IMPLEMENTATION PLANS ARE GROUNDED IN PUBLIC HEALTH MODELS DEVELOPED WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND FEINBERG FACULTY, IN WHICH RESIDENTS OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE INFORMED AND ABLE TO MAKE HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHOICES, MANAGE THEIR CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS AND RECEIVE MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES IN THE MOST APPROPRIATE SETTING. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR MISSION TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE IS BEST ACCOMPLISHED IN COLLABORATION WITH PARTNERS IN BOTH THE COMMUNITY AND WITHIN THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT COMPRISE NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE, INCLUDING THE HEALTH SYSTEM AND FEINBERG. OUR AFFILIATIONS WITH COMMUNITY-BASED HEALTHCARE AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS ENABLE THE HEALTH SYSTEM'S ORGANIZATIONS TO MEANINGFULLY IMPROVE ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY HEALTH CARE AND IMPLEMENT TARGETED PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THE HIGHEST-PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED LARGE-SCALE PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITIES USING THIS FRAMEWORK TO TARGET HIGH-PRIORITY HEALTH CONDITIONS AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE PUBLIC HEALTH MODELS TO ADDRESS PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS IDENTIFIED THROUGH OUR CHNAS. ONGOING EFFORTS DRAW ON NMHC'S AND FEINBERG'S STRENGTHS IN PUBLIC HEALTH, COMMUNICATION AND EDUCATION, AND INCLUDE PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS IN COMMUNITIES SERVED ACROSS THE HEALTH SYSTEM. OUR HOSPITALS HAVE ENDURING RELATIONSHIPS, OFTEN DECADES OLD, WITH LOCAL HEALTHCARE AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. THROUGH THESE PARTNERSHIPS, WE COLLABORATE ON DETERMINING PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS THROUGH THE CHNA PROCESS AND WORK TOGETHER TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS THAT RESPECT THE VARIED CULTURAL, SOCIOECONOMIC AND PRACTICAL NEEDS OF OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. NORTHWESTERN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL: NMH COLLABORATES WITH COMMUNITY-BASED HEALTH, EDUCATION AND SOCIAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE HEALTH EDUCATION, OUTREACH SERVICES AND FOCUSED DISEASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS, AND TO ENSURE THAT THE RESIDENTS OF OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE CONVENIENT ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY MEDICAL HOMES.

        <ExplanationTxt>The communities served by NMHC hospitals are complex and diverse, encompassing rural, suburban and urban areas, with a range of socioeconomic statuses and social determinants of health that correspond to these demographics. NMHC is committed to providing care that takes into consideration the cultures and environments in which our patients live and is responsive to their needs. NMHC works closely with community partners, including health and social service partners, to identify priority health concerns and jointly develop community-based health initiatives designed to address healthcare disparities. Each NMHC hospital considers a variety of factors when defining its distinctive community. These factors include: geographic area served, principal functions of the hospital, areas of high hardship and the population served, the location of existing NM and community assets, and the service areas of other healthcare providers. By considering each of these factors, each NMHC hospital defined its own Community Service Area (CSA) and is working to meet the unique needs of the community it serves. Northwestern Memorial Hospital Service Area NMH serves a large, complex and diverse area with patients coming from the City of Chicago and surrounding counties. NMH's Hospital Service Area is defined as the Cities of Chicago and Evanston, which provides 69 percent of inpatient admissions. The community in NMH's Hospital Service Area is ethnically and racially diverse with large Black and Hispanic populations as well as large Polish and Spanish-speaking populations. Within NMH's Hospital Service Area, the population is expected to grow at a rate of 0.9 percent over the next five years. Significantly, nearly 20 percent of families live below the poverty level in NMH's Hospital Service Area. NMH is committed to providing culturally competent care that is responsive to the needs of all our patients, regardless of the ability to pay. NMH works with community health centers in some of Chicago's medically underserved areas to identify priority health concerns and jointly develop community-based health initiatives designed to address healthcare disparities. NMH defines its CSA as a seven-mile radius around the hospital, which includes 34 ZIP codes. Northwestern Medicine Lake Forest Hospital Service Area NM LFH primarily serves Lake County, which has a fairly stable population of around 704,000 residents; nearly 73 percent of inpatient admissions at NM LFH are derived from Lake County. While NM LFH's Hospital Service Area population is only expected to grow by 0.7 percent over the next five years, the over-65 population is growing rapidly. Between 2010 and 2015 (the most recent information available), the number of persons in Lake County 65 years and older increased by more than 2 percent. A total of 20.2% of Lake County residents are Hispanic or Latino. In looking at race independent of ethnicity, 78.7% of residents of Lake County are White and 14.4% are Black. NM LFH defines its community as Lake County in order to facilitate alignment with the Lake County Health Department (LCHD). Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital Service Area Located in Winfield, Illinois, NMCDH serves the residents of central and western DuPage County and beyond. NMCDH's Hospital Service Area accounts for 70 percent of inpatient admissions. Age distribution in the County includes 23.8 percent infants, children or adolescents (up 0.4 percent from the 2015 CHNA), 63.3 percent of residents are age 18 to 64 (up 1.1 percent), and the 12.9 percent of age 65 or older (up 0.6 percent). In looking at race independent of ethnicity, 79.4% of residents in DuPage County are White and 4.7% are Black. When considering ethnicity, 13.9% of DuPage residents are Hispanic or Latino. The county has a higher proportion of white residents and a lower proportion of black residents than the state and US. The percentage of Hispanic and Latino residents is also lower than found in the state and US. Northwestern Medicine Delnor Hospital Service Area NMDH primarily serves the residents of Kane County. Kane County is the seventh-youngest county in Illinois and notable for its age distribution. The median age remains 34.5 years as compared to the 2015 current Census Bureau average of 36.7 years. Those aged 18 to 24 comprise 61.1 percent of the population; 27.1 percent are age 0 to 17, and 11.7 percent are age 65 or older. Non-Hispanic whites now constitute 72.5 percent of the total population, an increase from 59 percent in the prior CHNA report, and Hispanics now comprise 31.4 percent of the total population. When compared to Illinois and the US in general, the proportion of Hispanics is double in Kane County, and the county has the largest proportion of Hispanics in the state. Northwestern Medicine Kishwaukee Hospital Service Area NMKH serves a majority of DeKalb County residents; the greater part of the county's residents live in the cities of DeKalb and Sycamore. The median age of DeKalb County residents is significantly lower than that of Illinois overall, at 30.3 years, or seven years less than the median age of an Illinois or US resident. 21.4 percent of residents are aged 20 to 29 years and 16.3 percent are aged from 10 to 19 years. Additionally, 11 percent of the population is aged 30 to 39, 11.8 percent comprises 40 to 49 years, 2.4 percent from 50 to 59 years, and 15.8 percent are over 60 years. The county population is 87 percent white, 8 percent black, 3 percent Asian and 2 percent is two or more races. When considering ethnicity, 11 percent of the population identified as Hispanic or Latino. Northwestern Medicine Valley West Hospital Service Area A critical access hospital in Sandwich, Illinois, NMVW primarily serves residents of DeKalb County, demographics as detailed with NMKH. NMVW's Hospital Service Area accounts for 72 percent of inpatient admissions. NM CDH, NM Delnor, NM Kishwaukee and NM Valley West define their CSA based on their Primary Service Area (PSA). The PSA is a contiguous set of ZIP codes within a defined geographical area that accounts for a majority percentage of inpatient admissions. Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital Service Area Located in Wheaton, Illinois, MRH largely serves the residents of DuPage County, demographics as discussed with regards to the NMCDH service area of DuPage County as well. However, due to the specialty nature of the hospital, MRH also serves as a destination hospital receiving patient referrals from surrounding counties including Cook, Will, Kane, Kendall, DeKalb and LaSalle. Due to the unique services offered by MRH, the hospital does not use a PSA to define its community. MRH considers DuPage County its CSA, but also serves as a destination hospital for surrounding counties. Patients often travel from Cook, Will, Kane, Kendall, DeKalb and LaSalle counties, among many more, to receive care at MRH. Northern Illinois Medical Center The hospitals comprising NIMC define their primary service area as McHenry County. The age distribution of the population was 29.5% aged 0-18, 56.5% aged 18-65, and 14.0% aged 65 and older as of the latest data available in 2017. McHenry County uninsured rates in 2017 were just 5.5% compared to the state uninsured rate of 7.8%. McHenry County also enjoys a relatively high socioeconomic status in comparison to the state at large, with median household income of $82,230 compared to the average $61,229. Together, the three NM hospitals in Chicago's northwest suburbs - NM McHenry, NM Huntley and NM Woodstock - serve the same CSA of McHenry County, which accounts for a majority of inpatient admissions.</ExplanationTxt>

        <ExplanationTxt>As described in earlier sections, NMHC believes that its mission to improve the health of the communities it serves is best accomplished in collaboration with partners in the community. The CHNA process and ongoing input from community partners inform how NMHC hospitals prioritize and address community health needs. Along with our many care locations, our community affiliations help us to provide care to residents near where they live or work, with streamlined pathways to access medically necessary hospital-based care. NMHC also sponsors numerous programs to provide mental health services, promote health and wellness, prevent injury and trauma, and provide healthcare career training, youth mentoring, language assistance and volunteer programs to enhance the quality and accessibility of care.
